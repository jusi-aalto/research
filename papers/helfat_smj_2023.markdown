## Abstract
The resource-based view is an enduring and impactful mainstay of research within strategic management and beyond. This editors’ introduction to the special issue on “new directions for the resource-based view” accomplishes two main tasks. First, we describe the contributions offered by the seven articles contained in the special issue. Second, we explain the potential value to research of incorporating into resource-based inquiry new contexts (artificial intelligence and digitization, distributed organizations, and stakeholders and sustainability); new concepts (resource redeployment, market shaping through resources and capabilities); and new methods (text analysis and machine learning, formal models, policy capturing). The overall aim of this introduction is to help invigorate the resource-based view by spotlighting a series of promising new directions.

**KEYWORDS**  
capabilities, firm performance, resource-based view, resources, sustained competitive advantage

## 1 | INTRODUCTION

At its core, the strategic management field is devoted to building greater understanding of positive and sustained firm performance (Hoskisson & Harrison, 2021; Nag, Hambrick, & Chen, 2007) along with value creation and capture (Brandenburger & Stuart, 1996). For over half a century, strategy scholars have pursued this issue and related questions from a variety of theoretical viewpoints (such as agency theory, transaction cost theory, institutional theory, and game theory, among many others) while relying on a myriad of concepts (such as organizational structure, top management teams, diversification, and market entry, among many others).

Perhaps because it is well suited to address what causes firms to perform well on a sustained basis, the resource-based view of the firm (RBV) has been one of the strategic management field’s biggest successes. Building on the foundational insights of Penrose (1959), Lippman and Rumelt (1982), Wernerfelt (1984), Barney (1986), and others, Barney (1991) presented the RBV as an emerging alternative to the externally focused work that had dominated the 1980s (e.g., Porter, 1980, 1985). The core concept within the RBV is strategic resources (Chi, 1994) which are distinguished from resources in general (such as cash) by having certain attributes: they are valuable, rare, inimitable, and nonsubstitutable (Barney, 1991). Examples of assets that can constitute strategic resources include patented technology, a unique organizational culture, and a strong brand name. Firms that possess such strategic resources can leverage them in order to enjoy sustained competitive advantages over rivals and profits that exceed industry norms (Peteraf, 1993).

Strategic management inquiry leveraging the RBV has grown tremendously in recent decades to become firmly entrenched as a central perspective for understanding organizations. Also, neighboring fields such as international business (e.g., Peng, 2001), entrepreneurship (e.g., Gillis, Combs, & Ketchen, 2014), supply chain management (Ketchen, Wowak, & Craighead, 2014), and human resource management (e.g., Hitt, Bierman, Shimizu, & Kochhar, 2001) have advanced by incorporating the RBV. Multiple meta-analyses have found support for the RBV’s tenets across extant studies (Crook, Ketchen, Combs, & Todd, 2008; Crook, Todd, Combs, Woehr, & Ketchen, 2011; D’Oria, Crook, Ketchen, Sirmon, & Wright, 2021) and a series of narrative reviews have codified both the progress made under the RBV banner and unexploited opportunities (Armstrong & Shimizu, 2007; Barney & Arikan, 2005; Barney, Ketchen, & Wright, 2011; D’Oria et al., 2021; Kraaijenbrink, Spender, & Groen, 2010; Lockett, Thompson, & Morgenstern, 2009). It was with an eye toward these unexploited opportunities that the editors of the Strategic Management Journal commissioned this special issue on “new directions for the RBV.”

## 2 | CONTENT OF THE SPECIAL ISSUE

We want to acknowledge the pivotal role that the late Mike Wright played in the creation of this special issue. Before Mike’s untimely passing, he was deeply involved in conceptualizing the issue and composing its call for papers. Mike was universally respected by his peers, and his work during the early stages of this special issue matched his reputation.

In response to the call for papers, we received 96 submissions. This special issue includes seven of those papers. Not surprisingly for a special issue devoted to “new directions” of a seminal theoretical perspective in our field, five of the seven articles are theoretical. The remaining two articles make empirical and theoretical contributions. The articles tackle timely subjects, including firms in the digital economy, artificial intelligence (AI), strategic human capital, and firm stakeholders. The articles also analyze fundamental theoretical issues involving resources and capabilities.

Several themes run through the articles in this special issue. Many of the articles deal with the evolution of resources, including the articles on hyperscaling, resource search, resource decay, and competitive resource dynamics. In a related vein, two articles that feature human capital, involving AI and workflow interdependence, address changes over time in which resources create value. These two articles also examine interactions among resources and capabilities, and specifically whether managerial and human resources are substitutes or complements for other types of resources and capabilities. In addition, the articles on stakeholder theory and competitive resource dynamics examine the relationship between resources and value creation and capture. The roles of important factors that affect value creation and capture, namely competitors and complementors, arise in the articles on competitive resource dynamics and hyperscaling, respectively. Several of the articles also provide new perspectives on well-established concepts such as the strategic factor markets paradox and the VRIN/VRIO characteristics of resources, while bringing in new phenomena such as digital technologies and the rising importance of firm stakeholders.

Below we summarize each of the articles, which relate to three broad categories of opportunities for research on the RBV involving contexts, concepts, and methods that are relatively new to the RBV or have not been applied extensively to it. Table 1 provides an overview of the contributions that each article makes in one or more of these three categories. After summarizing the articles, we explore additional opportunities for research on the RBV on new contexts, new concepts, and new methods.

### 2.1 | Articles in the special issue

Successful digital firms often grow large, yet their businesses remain relatively specialized. **Giustiziero, Kretschmer, Somaya, and Wu (2023)** investigate why this occurs in “Hyperspecialization and Hyperscaling: A Resource-based theory of the Digital Firm.” The authors posit that when resource bundles have large advantages of scale, as is often the case for digital firms, the opportunity costs of expanding to other businesses are high. As a result, digital firms’ resources may lead to both a high degree of business specialization (“hyperspecialization”) and very large scale (“hyperscaling”). Using a formal model, the authors demonstrate that lesser business scope enables greater scale in specialized businesses even without reductions in market transaction costs. The model incorporates resource fungibility, resource accumulation costs, demand conditions, and the share of value captured by complementors. Based on their analysis, the authors argue that digital firms may remain less vertically integrated than the large industrial firms studied by Chandler (1990) and Penrose (1959). Beyond the insights that the model generates, the model provides a platform for further analysis of scalability in resource bundles.

AI is an important digital technology that managers increasingly seek to leverage. In addition, managerial resources have long been identified in the RBV as a fundamental source of differences in performance (Castanias & Helfat, 1991). The emergence of technologies that assist human decision-making, such as AI, challenges our understanding of the relationship between managerial resources and performance differentials. In the article on “AI and the Changing Sources of Competitive Advantage,” **Krakowski, Luger, and Raisch (2023)** study performance in chess tournaments that rely exclusively on human decision-making, and in tournaments that include AI either as an aid to human decision-making or as a full replacement for it. They find that human ability retains its role in explaining performance differences. However, the traditional player ability is no longer valuable when AI is used, while new kinds of human abilities, related to the use of AI, emerge as a source of performance differentials. Thus, even a widely available technology (AI), applied to a well-known competitive situation (chess), still presents opportunities for the emergence of human-based advantage, but one that can be disconnected from the previously useful human capital. The article shows the limits of any individual’s judgment in the face of the generalization of AI in the chess setting. The best experts at winning no longer hold an advantage when expertise is supplemented by AI, while new kinds of expertise can now make a difference. This suggests that organizations facing the challenge of incorporating AI in their decision-making may have to ensure enough variety in the skill sets of their managers.

Beyond the interaction with AI, human resources interact in other ways within organizations. In “Unpacking the ‘O’ in VRIO: The Role of Workflow Interdependence in the Loss and Replacement of Strategic Human Capital,” **Kim and Makadok (2023)** examine the damage from losing star and nonstar employees under different contexts. They use a unique sample—National Basketball Association teams from 1992 to 2010; a total of 522 team-season data points. In 2001, the league changed its rules in ways that inherently increased the importance of teamwork and diminished the importance of star players. This resulted in 255 data points prior to the rule change and 267 post-rule change. The rule change allows Kim and Makadok to study whether workflow interdependence moderates the influence of resources on performance. They find that losing a star employee is more harmful when the workflow is individual-focused. This damage can be mitigated, however, if the organization possesses strong employee-recruitment capabilities. Losing nonstar employees is more costly when the workflow is team-focused; this damage can be mitigated if the organization possesses a strong capability for improving the skills of existing employees. One implication is that capabilities need to be developed that match an organization’s preferred workflow approach and the organization’s likelihood of losing star and nonstar employees. A more general implication is that organizations require appropriate organizational structures and processes to benefit from heterogeneous human resources. This article advances resource-based research by leveraging a clever research design to shed new light on perhaps the most understudied element of the well-known VRIO framework.

Employees are one type of a firm’s stakeholder among many. In his article “Value, Rent, and Profit: A Stakeholder Resource-based Theory,” **Stoelhorst (2023)** squarely addresses many of the implications for traditional resource-based theory created by the need to incorporate a stakeholder perspective into this theory. Based on the assumption that economic value can be created through co-specialized investments among stakeholders that generates team production, the paper reconceptualizes the purpose of the firm—as a governance structure to facilitate such team production—and generalizes concepts familiar in resource-based theory—including value, rent, and profits—from a non-stakeholder to a stakeholder-oriented version of resource-based theory. In so doing, the paper also links this new version of resource-based theory to the value creation and appropriation framework that has grown in importance in the field of strategic management (Brandenburger & Stuart, 1996; Lieberman, Balasubramanian, & Garcia-Castro, 2018; Lieberman, Garcia-Castro, & Balasubramanian, 2017).

In “Resource Origins and Search,” **Felin, Kauffman, and Zenger (2023)** delve further into the fundamentals of resource-based theory by tackling the difficult question of how firms can locate resources with the potential to be valuable, rare, inimitable, and non-substitutable before competition for the resources bids up their prices—the well-known strategic factor markets conundrum (Barney, 1986). Drawing on insights from biology, the authors propose that firm-specific “search images” can help firms identify new resources before they are evident to others. A search image refers to the specification of a need or function that a not-yet-defined resource could fulfill. Armed with one or more search images, an organization can undertake a more targeted search in the external environment to identify “dormant value” in resources. This perspective supplements prior research on the search for resources that have unique firm-specific value or complementarities with existing resources.

Most resource-based inquiry centers on how resources arise, how they are managed, and/or how they affect performance. In “Strategic Resource Decay,” **Karadag and Poppo (2023)** flip the proverbial script by theorizing about how resources diminish and disappear. Surprisingly, this topic has received little attention in the past given that resources’ end can be readily observed when, for example, a patent expires or a star employee retires. To advance understanding of strategic resource decay, Karadag and Poppo create a seven-part typology of patterns of decay via two dimensions: tradability (tradable or non-tradable) and depletability/perishability (depletable, perishable, depletable and perishable, or perpetual). The authors develop a series of propositions that future scholars can leverage via empirical testing. They also build important conceptual bridges with work on resource management and resources’ performance that begin to articulate the role decay can play in investigations of these important topics. Overall, we hope that the solid conceptual foundation established by Karadag and Poppo will lead strategic resource decay to become a popular research focus in the coming years.

Giving formal foundations to the RBV is a quest that arguably started even before the RBV was articulated as such, with formal work investigating how chance could give rise to enduring advantages (Lippman & Rumelt, 1982). In “A Formal Framework for the RBV: Resource Dynamics as a Markov Process,” **Wibbens (2023)** provides a toolbox to model firms’ decisions and performance that places the state of resources and capabilities squarely at the center of the model. The assumption that all relevant past decisions can be summarized as a state variable gives the “Markov” moniker to the model, and zeroing in on resource characteristics as the essential state variables provides the connection to the RBV. In Wibbens’ (2023) framework, firms make decisions to change their resource endowments, accounting for other firms’ decisions. This setup can be readily extended to explore various mechanisms involving resource dynamics and competition. Wibbens provides a striking example of what the framework is capable of by exploring the “attractiveness paradox.” Long-lived superior resources, which intuitively seem superior to hold, may be less profitable than shorter-lived ones. The model notably shows that they attract more attempts at displacement by competitors and are thus more costly to defend. This kind of insight arises by bringing together the full dynamics of resource evolution, including the susceptibility of resources to erosion and the optimal decision-making of the players, which accounts for competition, all tied together in the Markov process framework. Many more resource-related questions could be explored within this highly customizable framework.

As shown in Table 1, some of the articles incorporate new contexts, namely digital firms, AI, and firms’ stakeholders. Some of the articles also use theoretical methods that are not often found in the literature on the RBV, namely decision-theoretic modeling, cooperative game theory logic, and Markov modeling and stochastic processes. The articles also develop or apply concepts that are new to the RBV: firm-specific search images, hyperspecialization and hyperscaling, resource decay, workflow interdependence, long-term competitive resource dynamics, and human-machine capabilities. In what follows, we discuss additional opportunities for research on the RBV of the firm, including but not limited to the topics covered in the articles in this special issue.

## 3 | OPPORTUNITIES FOR FUTURE RESEARCH ON THE RESOURCE-BASED VIEW

The RBV holds many opportunities for future research, some of which we highlight below. We begin with new contexts such as AI and digitization, distributed organizations, and stakeholders and sustainability, and some of the data and methods that may prove helpful for analyzing these contexts. Then, we turn to new concepts and new theoretical and empirical methods that hold promise for the RBV as a whole.

### 3.1 | New contexts

#### 3.1.1 Artificial intelligence and digitization

One exciting area for new applications of the RBV is the so-called “Digital Transformation”—the increasing digitization of products and services and the implications of this change for business strategy (Adner, Puranam, & Zhu, 2019). One stream of work in this area focuses on the effect that the digital nature of products and services has on the economics of competition. On the one hand—as exemplified by the Giustiziero et al. paper in this issue—the scale-free nature of digital offerings and the resulting negligible marginal costs (Levinthal & Wu, 2010), combined with the global reach of digital markets (Wormald, Shah, Braguinsky, & Agarwal, 2022) and various types of network effects associated with many digital contexts (Loh & Kretschmer, 2023; Parker & Van Alstyne, 2005; Zhu & Iansiti, 2012), suggests that digitization may create an impetus for hyperscaling, as a small number of firms (or potentially just one firm) come to dominate the market. On the other hand, digitization is also associated with lower costs of experimentation as entry barriers related to fixed costs are lowered (Jin & McElheran, 2017; Waldfogel, 2018), low-cost experimental techniques become available (Koning, Hasan, & Chatterji, 2022), and conventional knowledge constraints are overcome (Tajedin, Madhok, & Keyhani, 2019), as well as with improved access to detailed real-time customer data, suggesting the potential for greater learning-by-doing (Chen, Wang, Cui, & Li, 2021) and the opportunity for small and start-up firms to overcome their traditional disadvantages (Wormald, Agarwal, Braguinsky, & Shah, 2021) by targeting valuable niches in the market (Benner & Waldfogel, 2023; Dushnitsky, Piva, & Rossi-Lamastra, 2022). More work is needed to understand the factors that moderate the balance between these two effects of digitization—the drive to scale and the drive to differentiate (Cennamo & Santalo, 2013; Ellison & Fudenberg, 2003; Panico & Cennamo, 2022)—not only to understand the conditions under which one tendency may dominate the other (Schilling, 2002; Simcoe & Watson, 2019), but also to study the process through which digital markets evolve (Khanagha, Ansari, Paroutis, & Oviedo, 2022) and how this process compares to more traditional evolutionary models (Nelson & Winter, 1982). More work is also needed to examine how the strategies firms pursue—and the resources and capabilities they use to compete—vary with the nature of the impact of digitization (Helfat & Raubitschek, 2018). As the inevitability of winner-take-all outcomes in digital markets comes increasingly under question (Cennamo & Santalo, 2013; Simcoe & Watson, 2019), it seems likely that the competing pressures to scale and differentiate may create a segmented marketplace, with a few large firms serving mass-market preferences at scale while a plethora of smaller firms offer differentiated offerings to heterogeneous consumers—consistent with models of resource partitioning (Carroll, 1985), and technology competition under heterogeneous demand (Adner, 2002; Adner & Levinthal, 2001; Adner & Snow, 2010). It would be important to examine the resources and capabilities that underpin such niche strategies, whether they be based on network structure (Afuah, 2013; Lee, Lee, & Lee, 2006), quality of complementors (Cennamo & Santalo, 2013; Llanes, Mantovani, & Ruiz-Aliseda, 2019), customization to niche preferences (Dushnitsky et al., 2022), or superior innovativeness (Panico & Cennamo, 2022). To what extent is the choice of strategy in a digital marketplace driven and enabled by the firm’s existing complementary resources (Miller & Toh, 2022; Wang & Miller, 2020; Wormald et al., 2022)? Can (and should) firms redeploy resources from one segment to the other as market conditions change or technologies evolve (Kretschmer & Claussen, 2016)? And what would it take for a firm to successfully compete in both segments at once, either effectively customizing at scale, or pursuing “middle-tail strategies” that balance between segments (Benner & Waldfogel, 2023)?

More work is also required to investigate the implications of digitization on value appropriation and the resulting incentives to innovate. While digitization may boost innovation by lowering the costs of experimentation...

## 4 | CONCLUSION

Four decades have passed since Wernerfelt (1984) introduced the RBV into strategic management research and into the language of business. The RBV’s impact inside the strategic management field and in a wide array of other fields has been immense. While many theories leveraged in strategy research are imported from other fields, the RBV is “home grown” and thus should be a source of pride for strategic management scholars. Looking to the future, it is logical to wonder if the RBV will continue to play a key role in inquiry for another four decades. Will the RBV remain vibrant in 2064 or will it be relegated to the ash heap of research history? We believe that the RBV will continue to be an important guide for researchers for many years to come to the extent that new contexts, new concepts, and new methods are brought to bear over time.
