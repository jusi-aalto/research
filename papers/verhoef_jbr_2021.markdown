Digital transformation and resultant business model innovation have fundamentally altered consumers’ expectations and behaviors, putting immense pressure on traditional firms, and disrupting numerous markets. Drawing on extant literature, we identify three stages of digital transformation: digitization, digitalization, and digital transformation. We identify and delineate growth strategies for digital firms as well as the assets and capabilities required in order to successfully transform digitally. We posit that digital transformation requires specific organizational structures and bears consequences for the metrics used to calibrate performance. Finally, we provide a research agenda to stimulate and guide future research on digital transformation.

## 1. Introduction

Digital transformation and resultant business model innovation have fundamentally altered consumers’ expectations and behaviors, put immense pressure on traditional firms, and disrupted numerous markets (Accenture, 2017; Accenture, 2018; Grewal, Motyka, & Levy, 2018; Kannan & Li, 2017; Lamberton & Stephen, 2016; Lemon & Verhoef, 2016; Libai, Bart, Gensler, Hofacker, Kaplan, Kotte- mann, & Ukanwa, 2019; Verhoef, Kannan, & Inman, 2015; Verhoef, Neslin, & Vroomen, 2007; Verhoef, Reinartz, & Krafft, 2010; Wedel & Kannan, 2016; Yadav & Pavlou, 2014; Yadav & Pavlou, in press). In today’s business world, managers are increasingly confronted with responding to the advent of new digital technologies that blur market boundaries and change agent roles (e.g., customers become co-producers, competitors become collaborators, and firms that vertically integrate or bypass existing parties; Beckers, van Doorn, & Verhoef, 2018; Grewal & Veiga, 2013; Lamberton & Stephen, 2016; Parker, Van Alstyne, & Choudary, 2016). In order to provide managerial guidance for digital transformation, we must increase our understanding of how firms can gain a sustainable competitive advantage by building on specific resources, which strategies they should adopt to win, and how the firm’s internal organization structure must change to support these strategies. This paper thus contributes to existing discussions on digital transformation by taking a multidisciplinary focus (e.g., Grewal et al., 2018; Kumar et al., in press; Lamberton & Stephen, 2016; Lemon & Verhoef, 2016; Verhoef & Bijmolt, in press; Verhoef et al., 2015; Yadav & Pavlou, 2014; Yadav & Pavlou, in press). Moreover, this paper contributes to existing literature on digital transformation in itself (e.g., Kumar, Ramachandran, & Kumar, in press; Verhoef & Bijmolt, in press), because the emergence of digital transformation requires the building of a scientific knowledge base and development of a research agenda to stimulate the cumulativeness of future research in the multiple domains on this important topic.

In this paper, we aim to reflect on the phenomenon and the literature from multiple fields to aid an understanding of digital transformation and to stimulate future research by providing strategic imperatives and presenting a research agenda. We have the following three objectives: First, to identify the external factors that have strengthened the need for digital transformation. Second, to discuss the strategic imperatives that result from digital transformation regarding (1) required digital resources, (2) required organizational structure, (3) growth strategies, and (4) required metrics. Third, to present a research agenda that guides future (inter)disciplinary research on digital transformation.

In our discussion, we follow a commonly used flow model (depicted in Fig. 1) to describe the drivers, phases or levels, and imperatives of digital transformation (cf. Parker, Van Alstyne, & Choudary, 2016; Shah, Rust, Parasuraman, Staelin, & Day, 2006; Van Doorn et al., 2010). We start with a discussion on the external drivers of digital transformation, which presents the background of our discussion. Next, we analyze the literature from multiple disciplines to discuss the phases of digital transformation. Based on an understanding of these phases, we discuss the strategic imperatives that result from digital transformation, including digital resources, organizational structure, growth strategy, and metrics and goals. To conclude our discussion, we propose a research agenda for future research on digital transformation.

## 2. The need for digital transformation

We identify three major external factors driving the need for digital transformation. First, already since the coming of the World Wide Web and its worldwide adoption, an increasing number of accompanying technologies (e.g., broadband internet, smartphones, Web 2.0, SEO, cloud computing, speech recognition, online payment systems, and crypto-currencies) have risen that have strengthened the development of e-commerce. E-commerce global sales were $2.3 trillion in 2017 and e-retail revenues are projected to grow to $4.88 trillion in 2021 (Statista, 2019). The omnipresence of big data (e.g., Dong & Yang, in press; Wedel & Kannan, 2016) and advent of emerging digital technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain, internet-of-things (IoT), and robotics, are projected to have far-reaching effects on business (Chen, Chiang, & Storey, 2012; Iansiti & Lakhani, 2014; Ng & Wakenshaw, 2017). Although perhaps not each of these technologies will be as powerful as expected, the wide entrance of new digital technologies clearly signals the need for firms to transform their business digitally. Moreover, these new digital technologies may also affect the firm’s cost structure through replacing costlier humans during service delivery with the help of robots or virtual agents or optimizing logistic streams and reducing supply chain costs through the use of AI and blockchain.

Second, due to these new digital technologies, competition is changing dramatically. In retail, technologies have disrupted the competition landscape, shifting sales to relatively young digital firms. Not only has the competition become more global, the intensity has also increased as big, information-rich firms from the U.S. (e.g., Amazon, Alphabet, Apple, and Facebook) and China (e.g., Alibaba, and JD) start to dominate numerous industries. Notably, changes in firm valuations strongly reflect this shift. Just a decade ago, the five most valuable firms of the S&P 500 Index included Exxon, GE, Microsoft, Gazprom, and Citigroup, only one of which was truly digital. On May 2018, the S&P’s top five most valuable firms were all digital including Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, and Facebook. The dramatic rise of digital firms is even more noticeable given that the FAANG stocks (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, and Google), which constitute just 1% of the S&P 500, caused a massive surge between March and May 2017 of $260 billion in market valuation, while the remaining 99% lost $260 billion in the same period (Insider, 2017a).

Third, consumer behavior is changing as a response to the digital revolution. Market figures show that consumers are shifting their purchases to online stores, and digital touchpoints have an important role in the customer journey affecting both online and offline sales (Kannan & Li, 2017). With the help of new search and social media tools, consumers have become more connected, informed, empowered, and active (e.g., Lamberton & Stephen, 2016; Verhoef et al., 2017). Digital technologies allow consumers to co-create value by designing and customizing products, perform last-mile distribution activities, and help other customers by sharing product reviews (Beckers, van Doorn, & Verhoef, 2018; Grewal & Veiga, 2013). Mobile devices have become important in today’s consumer behavior and facilitate showrooming behavior, the practice of examining merchandise offline, and then buying it online (e.g., Gensler, Neslin, & Verhoef, 2017). Consumers also strongly rely on apps, and new AI-based technologies, like Amazon’s Echo and Google Home, that are entering consumers’ lives. These new digital technologies are likely to structurally change consumer behavior (cf. Hoffman & Novak, 2017; Verhoef et al., 2017), and, consequently, the use of new digital technologies can easily become the new norm and defy traditional business rules. If firms cannot adapt to these changes, they become less attractive to customers, and are likely to be replaced by firms that do leverage such technologies.

## 3. The phases of digital transformation

Given the multidisciplinary nature and broad coverage of digital transformation research, we reviewed the multidisciplinary literature to understand what is known about firms’ digital transformation. To better understand the existent knowledge, the intersection of different fields must be studied rather than relying on a single field (Tarafdar & Davison, 2018). A cross-discipline exchange of knowledge helps to better grasp the strategic imperatives of digital transformation, as it involves multiple functional areas, including marketing, information systems, innovations, strategic and operations management. Treating digital transformation – as existent research has done – in functional silos would potentially lead to ignoring relevant aspects or not optimizing cross-fertilization opportunities. For scholars, understanding the different research streams helps to stimulate the cumulativeness of research (cf. Foss & Saebi, 2017). For practitioners, it is necessary to bring together the insights from information systems, marketing, strategic management, information, and operations management in order to use sound organization-wide decisions about how to respond to digital technologies and implement digital organizational changes.

We conducted a scoping review approach (Paré, Trudel, Jaana, & Kitsiou, 2015) to understand how the multiple disciplines have conceptualized and defined digital transformation (See Appendix A). Our review of the different fields of information systems, marketing, innovation, and strategy reveals that all streams identify multiple phases or stages<sup>1</sup> of digital change, ranging from relatively simple to more pervasive changes. Based on our scoping review, we identify three phases of digital transformation: digitization, digitalization, and digital transformation. Most of the literature subscribes that the first two more incremental phases are needed to attain the most pervasive phase of digital transformation (Loebbecke & Picot, 2015; Matt, Hess, & Benlian, 2015; Parviainen, Tihinen, Kääriäinen, & Teppola, 2017).

<sup>1</sup> The literature uses phases and stages interchangeably. In the remaining of the paper, we refer to phases to indicate the pervasiveness of the digital change a firm undertakes.

Digitization is the encoding of analog information into a digital format (i.e., into zeros and ones) such that computers can store, process, and transmit such information (Dougherty & Dunne, 2012; Loebbecke & Picot, 2015; Tan & Pan, 2003; Yoo, Henfridsson, & Lyytinen, 2010). Research also refers to digitization as a change of analog to digital tasks (Li, Nucciarelli, Roden, & Graham, 2016; Sebastian et al., 2017), or conceptualized it as the integration of IT with existing tasks, and, more broadly, as the development or enablement of cost-effective resource configurations using IT (Lai, Wong, & Cheng, 2010; Vendrell-Herrero, Bustinza, Parry, & Georgantzis, 2017). Based on the above, we define digitization to describe the action to convert analog information into digital information. Examples concern the use of digital forms in ordering processes, the use of digital surveys, or the use digital applications for internal financial declarations. Typically, digitization mainly digitalizes internal and external documentation processes, but does not change value creation activities.

Digitalization describes the adoption of digital technologies to improve or innovate business processes (Legner et al., 2017; Li et al., 2016; Loebbecke & Picot, 2015; Yoo et al., 2010). Digitalization uses digitized information to simplify or improve existing processes, resulting in more efficient or effective processes (Dougherty & Dunne, 2012; Loebbecke & Picot, 2015). Research typically refers to digitalization as the use of digital technologies to change a firm’s business operations (Pagani & Pardo, 2017; Parviainen et al., 2017). We define digitalization as the use of digital technologies to optimize existing business processes. Examples include the use of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems to optimize supply chains, the use of Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems to improve customer targeting, or the use of digital technologies to improve internal communication processes. Typically, digitalization does not change the firm’s value creation processes, but optimizes the existing ones.

Digital transformation, the most pervasive phase, involves a more fundamental change as it uses digital technologies to change a firm’s value creation processes resulting in new business models (Loebbecke & Picot, 2015; Matt et al., 2015; Vendrell-Herrero et al., 2017). Digital transformation typically involves the integration of digital technologies in all areas of a business, fundamentally changing how firms operate and deliver value to customers (Iansiti & Lakhani, 2014; Matt et al., 2015; Sebastian et al., 2017). We define digital transformation as the use of new digital technologies to enable major business improvements, such as new business models, to enhance customer experience, or to streamline operations. Examples include the development of platform business models, such as those adopted by Uber or Airbnb, the use of IoT to develop new data-driven services, or the use of AI to personalize customer offerings. Digital transformation requires a complete rethinking of how firms operate, which typically involves changes in the firm’s strategy, organization, and culture.

## 4. Strategic imperatives of digital transformation

Given the pervasive impact of digital transformation, firms need to reconsider their strategies to remain competitive. We discuss four strategic imperatives that result from digital transformation: (1) digital resources, (2) organizational structure, (3) growth strategies, and (4) metrics and goals.

### 4.1. Digital resources

Digital transformation requires specific resources and capabilities to successfully implement digital technologies. We identify three key digital resources: digital assets, digital capabilities, and digital talent.

**Digital assets** refer to the technological infrastructure that supports digital transformation. This includes hardware, software, and data (Bharadwaj, El Sawy, Pavlou, & Venkatraman, 2013; Iansiti & Lakhani, 2014). For instance, firms need robust cloud computing infrastructure, advanced analytics platforms, and secure data storage systems to support digital initiatives. Data, in particular, is a critical asset, as it enables firms to gain insights into customer behavior, optimize operations, and develop new services (Dong & Yang, in press; Wedel & Kannan, 2016).

**Digital capabilities** refer to the firm’s ability to integrate, build, and reconfigure digital technologies to meet changing business requirements (Bharadwaj et al., 2013; Teece, 2018). These capabilities include the ability to develop and deploy new digital technologies, integrate digital and physical processes, and leverage data analytics to drive decision-making. For instance, firms with strong digital capabilities can quickly adapt to new technologies, such as AI or blockchain, and integrate them into their business processes.

**Digital talent** refers to the human capital required to drive digital transformation. This includes employees with technical skills, such as data scientists, software developers, and cybersecurity experts, as well as employees with digital business skills, such as digital marketers and product managers (Deloitte, 2015; Kane, Palmer, Phillips, Kiron, & Buckley, 2015). Firms need to attract, retain, and develop digital talent to successfully implement digital transformation initiatives. Moreover, digital transformation requires a cultural shift, where employees embrace digital technologies and are willing to experiment and innovate (Sebastian et al., 2017).

### 4.2. Organizational structure

Digital transformation requires firms to adapt their organizational structure to support the integration of digital technologies. Traditional hierarchical structures are often too rigid to support the fast-paced, innovative environment required for digital transformation (Bharadwaj et al., 2013; Matt et al., 2015). We identify three key organizational changes: cross-functional teams, agile methodologies, and digital leadership.

**Cross-functional teams** bring together employees from different departments, such as marketing, IT, and operations, to collaborate on digital initiatives. These teams enable firms to break down silos, foster innovation, and accelerate decision-making (Bharadwaj et al., 2013; Kane et al., 2015). For instance, a cross-functional team might include a data scientist, a digital marketer, and an operations manager working together to develop a new data-driven service.

**Agile methodologies** refer to flexible, iterative approaches to project management that enable firms to quickly adapt to changing requirements (Rigby, Sutherland, & Takeuchi, 2016). Agile methodologies, such as Scrum or Kanban, are particularly suited for digital transformation, as they allow firms to test and refine digital initiatives in real-time. For instance, firms can use agile methodologies to develop and launch a minimum viable product (MVP) and then iterate based on customer feedback.

**Digital leadership** refers to the role of senior executives in driving digital transformation. Digital leaders need to set a clear vision for digital transformation, align the organization around this vision, and foster a culture of innovation and experimentation (Kane et al., 2015; Sebastian et al., 2017). Moreover, digital leaders need to bridge the gap between business and technology, ensuring that digital initiatives are aligned with the firm’s strategic objectives.

### 4.3. Growth strategies

Digital transformation enables firms to pursue new growth strategies that leverage digital technologies. We identify three key growth strategies: platform-based strategies, ecosystem-based strategies, and servitization strategies.

**Platform-based strategies** involve the development of digital platforms that connect multiple stakeholders, such as customers, suppliers, and partners (Parker et al., 2016; Van Alstyne, Parker, & Choudary, 2016). Platforms create value by facilitating interactions between stakeholders, such as buyers and sellers on Amazon or drivers and riders on Uber. Platform-based strategies enable firms to scale rapidly, as they leverage network effects, where the value of the platform increases as more users join.

**Ecosystem-based strategies** involve the creation of a network of interconnected firms that collaborate to deliver value to customers (Iansiti & Levien, 2004; Jacobides, Cennamo, & Gawer, 2018). Ecosystems enable firms to leverage the capabilities of partners to deliver innovative products and services. For instance, Apple’s ecosystem includes app developers, hardware manufacturers, and content providers, all of whom contribute to the value of Apple’s products.

**Servitization strategies** involve the transition from selling products to selling services, enabled by digital technologies (Vendrell-Herrero et al., 2017). For instance, firms can use IoT to monitor product performance and offer predictive maintenance services, or use data analytics to offer personalized subscription-based services. Servitization strategies enable firms to create new revenue streams and build stronger customer relationships.

### 4.4. Metrics and goals

Digital transformation requires firms to rethink the metrics and goals they use to measure performance. Traditional financial metrics, such as revenue and profit, are often insufficient to capture the value created by digital initiatives (Katsikeas, Morgan, Leonidou, & Hult, 2016). We identify three key types of metrics: customer-centric metrics, operational metrics, and innovation metrics.

**Customer-centric metrics** focus on measuring customer engagement, satisfaction, and loyalty (Kannan & Li, 2017; Verhoef et al., 2010). Examples include Net Promoter Score (NPS), customer lifetime value (CLV), and customer engagement metrics, such as time spent on a digital platform or number of interactions. These metrics help firms understand how digital initiatives impact customer behavior and relationships.

**Operational metrics** focus on measuring the efficiency and effectiveness of digital processes (Bharadwaj et al., 2013). Examples include process cycle time, cost per transaction, and system uptime. These metrics help firms assess the impact of digitalization on operational performance and identify areas for improvement.

**Innovation metrics** focus on measuring the success of digital innovation initiatives (Kane et al., 2015). Examples include the number of new digital products launched, the percentage of revenue from digital services, and the speed of innovation cycles. These metrics help firms assess the impact of digital transformation on their ability to innovate and compete.

## 5. Research agenda

Given the pervasive impact of digital transformation, we propose a research agenda to guide future research. We identify five key research areas: (1) digital resources, (2) organizational structure, (3) growth strategies, (4) metrics and goals, and (5) interdisciplinary research.

The first important research area is digital resources. What are the critical digital assets, capabilities, and talent required for successful digital transformation? How can firms develop or acquire these resources, and what are the barriers to doing so? For instance, how can firms attract and retain digital talent in a competitive labor market? Moreover, how can firms balance the need for internal development of digital capabilities with the need to partner with external providers?

The second important research area is organizational structure. How should firms adapt their organizational structure to support digital transformation? What are the optimal configurations of cross-functional teams, agile methodologies, and digital leadership? For instance, how can firms balance the need for centralized control with the need for decentralized innovation? Moreover, how can firms foster a culture of innovation and experimentation while maintaining operational efficiency?

The third important research area is growth strategies. What are the most effective growth strategies for firms undergoing digital transformation? How do platform-based, ecosystem-based, and servitization strategies differ in their impact on firm performance? For instance, when should a firm pursue a platform-based strategy versus an ecosystem-based strategy? Moreover, how can incumbent firms compete with digital entrants that leverage these strategies?

The fourth important research area is metrics and goals. Which sets of intermediate and outcome-based metrics should firms use to measure their value creation and business performance during the different phases of digital transformation? How does firms’ use and importance of metrics evolve across the different phases of digital transformation? Prior research has considered the use of specific metrics within marketing (e.g., Katsikeas et al., 2016), but more research is required to assess how digital transformation may affect the usage and usefulness of performance metrics. Furthermore, given the increasing importance of digital platforms, research is needed to understand how specific metrics affect these firms, and how such metrics may help them to make more informed strategic decisions. For instance, how can digital platforms that rely on the inputs of multiple users develop relevant metrics to capture users’ sentiment and engagement in order to explain their co-creation and sharing willingness?

The fifth important research area is interdisciplinary research. Given the multidisciplinary nature of digital transformation and interdependencies that exist in business models (Christensen, Bartman, & van Bever, 2016), it is imperative that researchers from different fields work together to not only expand our knowledge on these five independent themes, but also actively establish linkages between these themes and disciplines to develop a more holistic understanding of why, how, and when digital transformation works. Such interdisciplinary research helps practitioners to make sound strategic decisions about how to respond to digital technologies and implement digital change.

To conclude, we believe that digital transformation will be a very relevant, multidisciplinary area for future research given the recent developments of digital technologies. In this paper, we have provided a rich and timely discussion on digital transformation and proposed how digital transformation places specific demands on organizations. We hope that our discussion and research agenda will stimulate future research on digital transformation.

## Appendix A: Review methodology

The goal of this scoping review is twofold. First, we aim to assess how digital transformation has been studied across fields to address how digital transformation has been conceptualized across the different fields to identify key similarities and differences. The reason to choose a multidisciplinary approach rather than focusing on contributions within one research field is because we believe that a broad phenomenon like digital transformation with wide implications for firms and society cannot be fully understood by only studying it within, for instance, the IS field (Loebbecke & Picot, 2015). A concept that exists at the intersection of different fields must be studied using an integrative approach rather than relying on a single field (Tarafdar & Davison, 2018). Hence, ignoring contributions from specific fields would bias our understanding of digital transformation.

The second goal of this review is to assess the different phases of digital transformation. Scholars have used a variety of concepts as substitutes or complementary elements when theorizing about firms’ digital transformation such as e-business usage to describe digital transformation (e.g., Zhu, Dong, Xu, & Kraemer, 2006). Therefore, we analyze the final set of papers thematically to assess the important themes of digital transformation. Given that the same keyword can have a (partly) different meaning in other disciplines, we argue that this thematic analysis helps us to better conceptualize digital transformation. Hence, this review also assesses how digital transformation has been studied across fields (including related constructs) to identify their similarities and differences.

**Step 1: Selection of fields of interest.** We use a systematic multistep concept-centric literature search (Webster & Watson, 2002), given the absence of widely accepted definitions and the broad nature of digital transformation. We selected five fields of interest: information systems, marketing, strategic management, innovation, and operations management. These fields were chosen because they are most likely to cover the strategic, technological, and operational aspects of digital transformation.

**Step 2: Selection of journals.** We selected high-quality journals in each field to ensure the relevance and rigor of the reviewed papers. For each field, we selected journals based on their impact factor and relevance to digital transformation. The selected journals include *MIS Quarterly*, *Information Systems Research*, *Journal of Marketing*, *Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science*, *Strategic Management Journal*, *Academy of Management Journal*, *Research Policy*, *Technovation*, *Management Science*, and *Operations Research*.

**Step 3: Selection of databases.** We used multiple databases to ensure comprehensive coverage of the literature, including Web of Science, Scopus, and Google Scholar. These databases were chosen because they cover a wide range of academic journals and provide advanced search capabilities.

**Step 4: Selection of keywords.** In the next step, we made a preliminary search using different databases and articles to identify a set of keywords to guide our search. The criterion for keywords is that we have to include specific keywords for the topic but also general keywords to account for similar constructs that are similar but use a different name. We included the keywords “digitalize”, “digital transformation”, and “digitize” as well as “IT” or “IS” in combination with “transformation” to cover the broad meaning of digital transformation and account for varieties in the focus across different disciplines. We acknowledge that also other keywords can be interesting or relevant but believe that our set will sufficiently cover our key criterion.

**Step 5: Identification and screening.** The search process generated over 8500 papers that fitted the selected keywords (see Fig. A1). This large number is mainly caused by our broad set of keywords. Papers were first scanned by title; papers that were deemed relevant to the goal of the study were considered by reading their abstracts. In total, we screened the abstracts of 760 papers. From this list of papers, we derived our preliminary set by including papers for closer review that we perceived best fitted our study goal. We excluded 605 papers, leaving us with a preliminary sample of 155 papers (most of them in the IS field).

**Step 6: Eligibility.** We subjected the 155 papers to check their relevance, and exclude irrelevant studies. We applied three criteria to ensure that the selected papers are of high relevance and quality.

1. Papers should use digital transformation-related concepts as major constructs. Papers were excluded when the digital transformation was only included in the keywords, abstract, or introduction but not further explained in the text. Furthermore, papers were excluded when mentioning digital transformation only as a possible implication of other research done.
2. Papers should include some theoretical notions for digital transformation (or related constructs); either by providing a theoretical notion based on earlier work, or by developing a notion of what is exactly meant with digital transformation. Papers that did not provide at least a conceptual or operational meaning were excluded.
3. Papers should use the concepts related to digital transformation in the core of the theoretical section (e.g., by being included in hypotheses, propositions, and/or research model) to make sure that digital transformation played a key role in the development of the paper.

**Step 7: Coding of articles.** The eligibility process resulted in a final sample of 84 papers that fulfilled all three criteria. The identification, screening, and coding of papers was done by a single coder.

**Step 8: Thematic analysis.** We applied thematic analysis to the selected papers to address how the different terms were used and if their meaning is comparable or different across fields. In doing so, we used a second coder to independently code a 20% random sample. The interrater reliability using Cohen’s kappa (Cohen, 1960) was very high (kappa = 0.82). In Table A1, we provide our results of coding across disciplines.
