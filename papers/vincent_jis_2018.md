## Abstract

The Security and Exchange Commission's 2009 enhanced proxy disclosure requirements and the updated Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO) internal control framework have caused organizations to increase their focus on risk management. The guidelines direct top management and the board to specifically consider the impact of information technology (IT) in enterprise risk management. Consequently, our study examines whether board involvement, board expertise, and top management's risk culture affect the maturity of IT risk management practices in firms.

We survey experienced IT professionals and find that board involvement positively influences the maturity of IT risk management practices. The results also indicate that risk taking behavior by top managers is associated with a lower maturity of IT risk management practices. We find that board expertise influences maturity, but board involvement is more important than expertise in explaining maturity. Maturity is higher in firms where risk oversight lies with a board-level, rather than a management, committee. The results also indicate that the maturity of IT risk management practices does not differ among firms whether risk oversight lies with the overall board, audit committee, risk committee or technology committee. The findings contribute to an under-researched area in IT governance and provide guidance on board oversight.

**Key words:** Board Involvement, Board Expertise, Risk Culture, IT Risk Management Practices, Maturity of IT Risk Management Practices, Risk Exposure, Strategic use of IT

## I. Introduction

In an effort to increase disclosure transparency, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in 2009 approved enhanced proxy disclosure requirements regarding the board of directors' role in the oversight of risk management.¹ Consequently, firms must report how the board executes its responsibility for risk oversight and the relationship between the board and its senior management in managing the material risks facing the firm. A few years later, the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO) updated its 1992 internal control framework to reflect the changes in the business environment such as expectations for governance/oversight, reliance on technology, globalization of markets, and expectations relating to preventing and detecting fraud (COSO 2013). Compliance with both the enhanced proxy disclosure requirements and the updated COSO framework necessitates that management and the board recognize the impact of technology and the status of the firm's risk management practices.

Wilkin and Chenhall (2010) highlight information technology (IT) risk management as an important, unaddressed aspect of IT governance (ITG) and identify the roles of senior management and the board as an under-researched area within IT risk management. Therefore, we begin to address this research gap by exploring whether various aspects of IT governance identified in the academic and anecdotal literatures influence the maturity of IT risk management practices.²

Risk management has evolved from being annual discussions at strategic meetings to embedded risk management strategies integrated into daily operations. In order to increase transparency of risks, management and the board should consider all aspects of risk associated with strategy, operations, and compliance (PwC 2008). Greater utilization of IT in business processes and increased incidents of cyberattacks have brought significant attention to IT risk management practices (PwC 2013).³ A recent ISACA (2015) survey reports that security breaches surged 48 percent from 2013 to 2014. Consequently, firms need to establish, follow, monitor, and maintain mature IT risk management practices to mitigate these and other IT-related threats.

Maturity is a complex construct. Our definition of maturity is derived from Debreceny and Gray (2013). Although they study IT governance, they draw on the definition of maturity from the software development literature suggesting that this definition can be used in multiple domains. They argue that capability maturity will lead to process standardization, which in turn is associated with process maturity. Analogously, we use a similar argument regarding maturity of IT risk management practices. We measure the extent to which management and the board continue to perform particular activities to identify, assess, monitor and respond to IT related risks, consistent with the Risk IT Framework (ISACA 2009a) and COBIT 5 (ISACA 2012).4

COSO (2013) also addresses the roles of the board and management in the control environment component of its internal control framework. Specifically, the board sets the oversight tone through expertise and involvement, while senior management sets the tone of the firm's risk culture through behaviors and attitudes. Thus, tone at the top, an element of the control environment, has a potentially significant influence on the firm's risk management practices.

Despite greater board involvement in ITG recently, directors have expressed concern whether they possess sufficient IT expertise to provide adequate oversight (PwC 2013). The ITG literature suggests the need for more board involvement and increased board level IT expertise. However, these studies focus on IT investments rather than IT risk management (e.g., Andriole 2009; Jewer and McKay 2012). Consequently, the potentially significant effects of board IT expertise and involvement on IT risk management have not been empirically explored.

Additionally, the COBIT 5 framework identifies risk culture as an important factor in IT risk management and IT governance (ISACA 2012). However, the impact of management's risk taking behavior on IT risk management practices has not been explored in the extant literature. In the organizational behavior literature, stewardship theory, the theory of expertise, and the theory of achievement motivation have been used to explore motivations for board composition, management behavior, and the resulting impact on firm performance, respectively. We rely on these same theories to explore the role of the board's IT expertise, IT involvement, and top management's risk culture on the maturity of the firm's IT risk management practices.

We used structural equation modeling in our tests and survey experienced IT professionals to obtain perceptions related to the maturity of IT risk management practices (hereafter maturity), board involvement, board expertise, risk culture, IT risk exposure, strategic use of IT, and competitive pressures. We employ a scale based on the Risk IT framework (ISACA 2009a) developed by Vincent et al. (2017) to measure 19 practices related to IT Risk Management in the dimensions of benefit/value enablement and operations/service delivery. We use a parceling technique on the 19 items to further refine the dependent variable.

Initial results indicate that board involvement and expertise positively influence maturity, but board involvement is more important to maturity than the board's level of IT expertise. Further, maturity is lower when senior management engages in high-risk behaviors. We also find that maturity does not keep up with increases in the level of IT utilization and IT risk exposure. Additionally, we find that maturity does not differ when delegating risk oversight to various board level committees (overall board, audit, risk, or technology committee); however, maturity is higher when the risk oversight responsibility lies with a board-level committee rather than a management committee. In aggregate, results suggest that 1) board involvement is crucial to maturity and that 2) IT risk oversight should lie with the board or one of its committees.

Our study contributes to both academic research and practice. We answer the call of Wilken and Chenhall (2010) to conduct more research on IT governance, specifically in the area of IT risk management and the respective roles of management and the board. We also use the specific case of IT risk to apply the theory from the achievement-motivation literature to explore the relationship between management's overall risk taking behavior and maturity.

From a practice perspective, we identify management and board-level factors that influence maturity. Specifically, our findings indicate that board involvement is associated with maturity and confirm the argument that boards should be involved in ITG as discussed in the prescriptive literature (e.g., Jewer and McKay 2012). Our results directly address directors' concerns over whether the lack of board-level IT expertise is a potential problem in providing adequate risk oversight (PwC 2013). We find that board involvement contributes more towards maturity than IT expertise. This is consistent with the board being able to hire subject matter experts when needed on highly technical issues. Finally, our results suggest that board level oversight is a more effective option than management oversight.

## II. Literature Review and Hypothesis Development

### Board Involvement in IT Risk Management

The board has both a monitoring and advising role (Adams and Ferreira 2007). The board's relationship with senior management can be described as either "controlling" based on an agency perspective or "collaborating" based on stewardship theory (Fields 2007). Stewardship theory suggests that boards guide various management practices through advice, collaboration, and oversight. Using stewardship theory, the management literature examines the effects of board involvement on restructuring (Johnson et al. 1993), quality improvement (Weech-Maldonado 1999), strategic decision making (Ruigrok et al. 2006; Kim et al. 2012), and senior management conflict (Buchholtz et al.2005). Aggregate findings suggest that board involvement positively influences numerous management practices.

Despite the positive results found above, the ITG literature has explored few issues involving board involvement (Andriole 2009). The descriptive literature recognizes a gap between technology investments and board involvement (Moran 2005; Burson-Marsteller 2005), and the prescriptive literature suggests that boards should get more involved in IT-related issues (Nolan and McFarlan 2005; Cash and Pearlson 2005).5 The overall conclusion from the ITG literature is that board involvement is not adequate and significant issues, like governance in the IT risk management context, are not adequately considered (Huffs et al. 2004; Andriole 2009; Bart and Turel 2010).

IT risk management has become an essential component of the firm's overall risk management strategy due to 1) a greater number of cyberattacks and 2) increased disclosures for the board to consider related to risk (SEC 2009). For example, PwC (2013) surveyed directors about IT oversight and found that boards are spending more time on IT issues. Further, a majority of respondents indicated that they want to spend more time considering IT related risks. The concerns raised by the directors indicate that they perceive a need to provide greater oversight, a notion consistent with stewardship theory.

The COSO Enterprise Risk Management Framework (ERM, COSO 2004), the COSO Integrated Framework (2013), and COBIT 5 (ISACA 2012) all recognize and emphasize the importance of board oversight. The three frameworks suggest that the board should get involved in ITG through evaluating, directing, and monitoring IT initiatives. Since IT risk management is a major component of IT governance, a firm's assessment of enterprise risks should also include IT risks. Based on stewardship theory and the previously-cited literature, we contend that boards that are "involved" in IT risk management practices engage in a combination of the following activities: embraces an advising role; guides management by asking IT risk management questions; discusses IT risk issues; directs management to prioritize IT risks; and monitors IT initiatives. Consequently, these IT-related priorities get passed on to managerial and operational activities; thus, resulting in maturity at the firm level. The first hypothesis is now given.

**H1: Board involvement is positively associated with the maturity of IT risk management practices.**

### IT Expertise at the Board Level

A recent PwC (2015) survey of board members indicates that only 25 percent of respondents believe that there is sufficient understanding of IT at the board level. The level of IT expertise may influence the adequacy of IT oversight, and thus, the maturity of IT risk management practices.

According to expert theory, an expert "can make an appropriate response to a situation that contains a degree of unpredictability" (Ericsson and Smith, 1991, p. 154). Prior accounting research suggests that having a financial expert increases the audit committee's ability to perform its duties (Abbott et al. 2004; Beasley et al. 2009); increases financial reporting quality (Felo et al. 2003); reduces earnings management (Bedard et al. 2004; He and Yang 2014); decreases restatements (Abbott et al. 2004); lessens the likelihood of material weaknesses in internal controls reported during an auditor change (Krishnan 2005); enhances firm value (Chan and Li 2008); increases analysts' confidence in financial reporting (Dickins et al. 2009); and increases efficiency (Huang et al. 2011).6 In aggregate, the expert theory literature suggests that an expert on the board positively influences management practices and that the market recognizes the value of the expert. Extrapolating this concept to IT, we expect that board members with IT expertise provide additional value to IT processes by increasing maturity.

Despite the broad range of expert theory-related studies, the research on board member IT expertise is very limited. Jewer and McKay (2012) find a positive relationship between the board's IT competency (measured by internal knowledge, external knowledge and experience/training) and the board's IT involvement. However, the extant literature has not extensively examined how IT expertise or involvement at the board level influences the areas of IT governance identified by the Wilkin and Chenhall (2010).7 Higgs et al. (2016) examines one aspect of risk management. They find that board level technology committees reduce the market reaction to breach announcements.

Research on expert behavior finds that knowledge acquired through education and experience enables experts to recognize patterns, identify strategic implications, organize knowledge around key concepts, respond to context, and self-regulate their focus (DeGroot 1965; Glaser 1992). Given the education, experience and the ability of an expert to formulate an appropriate response to uncertainty, an IT expert on the board will be able to recognize strategic implications of IT risks. Therefore, consistent with the conclusions reached in the audit committee expertise literature and our previous stewardship theory discussion, a board with IT experts will be better able to advise and oversee senior management with regard to IT risk management. Further, oversight by a board with IT expertise should encourage management to establish, enforce and follow better IT risk management practices; thereby, increasing the overall level of maturity. Our second hypothesis is now given.

**H2: IT expertise at the board level is positively associated with the maturity of IT risk management practices.**

### Risk Culture

The Risk IT framework (ISACA 2009a) indicates that the risk culture of the firm is an important aspect of IT risk management. The framework (p. 17) states that management and governance of IT risks depend on several characteristics of senior management: risk appetite and tolerance level; awareness and expectations; and behavior towards risk taking, negative outcomes, and policy compliance. Risk culture, defined as the predisposition of management towards taking risks (ISACA 2009a), is formed when senior managers communicate attitudes and inclinations towards risk-taking through statements and behaviors.

The risk taking behavior of individuals, as explained by the theory of achievement motivation, suggests that individuals who are achievement-oriented display more risk seeking behavior (Paunescu 2012). When a potential task is considered to have medium difficulty, achievement-oriented individuals are more inclined to take risks as it provides them with the best chance of success (Paunescu 2012). Prior research has established a link between senior management personality traits and firm performance. Gilley et al. (2002) and Auden et al. (2006) find that senior management's risk-taking behavior is positively correlated with firm performance, which suggests that some risk-taking behavior is essential to a firm's survival. Garrett et al. (2009) find that senior management's risk-taking behavior positively predicts pioneering markets. Further, Abatecola et al. (2013) indicate that the risk attitude of senior management is a predictor of firm processes and outcomes. Consequently, the maturity of IT risk management practices may differ among firms based on the risk culture among the senior management, because the same IT risk can be pursued differently by senior managers. Thus, a risk-seeking manager may decide to forgo establishing and monitoring more stringent IT risk management practices in order to more quickly increase competitive advantage or productivity.8

In sum, based on the arguments made above and consistent with the predictions made by the theory of achievement motivation, we hypothesize that when the top managers display more risk-taking behaviors (i.e. a high risk culture), IT risk management practices will be less mature.

**H3: Risk culture is negatively associated with the maturity of IT risk management practices.**

## III. Method

### Participants and Data Collection

ISACA agreed to post the survey link on the association's website and the notice to take the survey appeared in the monthly e-mail newsletter. Additionally, a personal e-mail was sent to the members of a local ISACA chapter and other IT professionals requesting their participation. The participants were Information Systems (IS) professionals in management positions. Qualified senior IS participants have titles such as IT manager, IT director, senior vice president of IT, chief technology officer (CTO), and IT security officer. Participants were asked to report demographic information and management's practices of their current or previous firm (if they held the position within the past five years) related to the firm's IT use, the board's IT expertise, the board's involvement in IT governance, the firm's IT risk exposure, the firm's risk culture.

There were 346 people who began the survey out of 2,200 emails sent, creating an initial 15.7% percent response rate. Participants were then eliminated for the following reasons: failure to give consent (6); did not meet job qualifications (7); did not complete the survey (93); and did not work for a firm with a board of directors (25). The final sample size is 215, which yields a 9.8% response rate. On average, participants took 30 minutes to complete the survey.

### Research Model

The research model in Figure 1 depicts the associations between maturity and the three independent variables of interest: board involvement; board IT expertise; and management risk culture. As stated previously, maturity is defined as the extent to which management continues to perform activities to identify, assess, monitor and respond to IT-related risks (ISACA 2009a). Further, the model introduces three other control variables (IT risk exposure, strategic use of IT, and competitive pressures) that directly and indirectly affect maturity.

[Insert Figure 1 about here]

### Dependent Variable

**IT Risk and IT Risk Management Practices**

The Risk IT Practitioner Guide (ISACA 2009b) provides a broad categorization of IT risks that are common to all firms regardless of the application and/or business context. Since the main construct of interest is maturity of IT risk management practices, we identify risk management practices associated with various categories of IT risks. Using the scale developed by Vincent et al. (2017 [see Appendix A]), we focus on the benefit/value enablement and operation/service delivery IT risk categories identified by ISACA 2009a, 2009b.? Vincent et al. (2017) identified 19 items reflecting benefit/value enablement and operations/service delivery IT risk management practices. Of the 19 items 10 items reflect benefit/value enablement and 9 items reflect operations/service delivery IT risk management practices. Data for the 19 best practices were measured using a 7-point Likert-type scale ranging from never to always (1=never, 4=occasionally, and 7=always). The respondents were asked to indicate how often a given management activity is performed and/or communicated. As a result, a management practice that is always performed implies formalization, hence a high level of maturity.

As described in the analysis section, we need to further parcel the dependent variables. The original two categories were based on the practitioner guide however, when we factor analyzed the constructs, we narrowed the number of items to 15 which loaded on four factors. We use these four factors as four parcels in our analysis.

### Independent Variables

**IT Expertise at the Board Level**

Board level IT expertise measures based on Jewer and McKay (2012) capture an individual's obtained level of education, experience, and training. Using a 7-point Likert-type scale, ranging from strongly disagree to strongly agree, we measure IT expertise by asking senior IT managers to indicate whether at least one director has worked directly in IT; whether at least one director has received formal training in IT; and whether at least one director has experience in the general management of IT.¹°

**Board Involvement**

We measure the participants' perceptions of the board's involvement in IT governance using three items on a 7-point Likert-type scale ranging from strongly disagree to strongly agree.¹¹ The three items are based on the COBIT 5 framework (ISACA 2012) and represent three broad areas of IT governance. The three statements are: the board of directors is involved in evaluating IT initiatives; the board of directors is involved in directing IT initiatives; and the board of directors is involved in monitoring IT initiatives.

**Risk Culture**

The Risk IT Practitioner Guide (ISACA 2009a) suggests that the risk culture of an organization can be based on senior management's behavior towards risk taking and attitude towards complying with policies/regulations and negative outcomes. Therefore, we used three items to measure the firm's risk culture based on the participants' perception on their senior management's behavior. The items are senior management in my organization 1) displays risk taking behavior 2) complies with policy requirements and 3) takes responsibility when negative outcomes occur.¹² Participants were asked to indicate their level of agreement with these statements using a 7-point Likert-type scale ranging from strongly disagree to strongly agree. When we performed a factor analysis, one item (displays risk taking behavior) did not load as expected. Therefore, this item was eliminated from the analysis, leaving the other two items to measure the construct.

### Control Variables

**IT Risk Exposure**

With regard to the control variables, we argue that firms need to assess their IT risk exposure, which will influence maturity. IT risk exposure is driven by the strategic use of IT which, in turn, is a function of competitive pressures. We also argue that IT risk exposure is reduced as maturity increases. When the risk exposure increases, firms should establish and follow management practices to identify, assess, monitor and respond to risk: thus, increasing maturity through formalization of such practices.

The IT risk exposure construct is based on the risk scenarios provided in the Risk IT Practitioner Guide (ISACA 2009b) for the IT benefit/value enablement and IT operation/service delivery risk categories. We use the method in Vincent et al. (2017) to reduce the risk scenarios from 16 to 12. If a risk scenario is applicable to both of our risk categories, the item is not used as we are trying to identify unique risks for each category. The twelve items broadly measure whether the participant's firm is at risk from selecting wrong programs for implementation, not adapting new technology, and disclosing information accidentally. These 12 items are measured on a 7 point Likert-type scale ranging from strongly disagree to strongly agree and were parceled into benefit/value enablement and operations/service delivery risks (See Appendix).

**Strategic use of IT**

Strategic use of IT is the relative importance of IT to the firm's ongoing operations. The questions and concerns of the board of directors on IT will differ based on the firm's IT needs (Nolan and McFarlan 2005), level of IT investment (Parent and Reich 2009), the firm's strategic use of IT, and the need for IT reliability (Bart and Turel 2010). Further, the annual corporate directors survey (PwC 2015) finds that directors are more aware of the impact of advances in technology and would like to give more board time to consider IT strategy. Thus, the frequency with which the board communicates with the senior management regarding IT governance depends on the extent of the firm's strategic use of IT. Extending these findings to the IT risk management context, the level of IT used in operations should impact the IT exposure and the extent to which management undertakes various IT risk management practices. Consequently, we expect a positive relationship between the strategic use of IT and both maturity and the firm's risk exposure.

The strategic use of IT is measured using six items based on Nolan and McFarlan's (2005) strategic impact gird. The items are measured on a 7-point Likert-type scale ranging from strongly disagree to strongly agree and appear in the Appendix.¹³

**Competitive Pressure**

Competitive pressure is the third control variable in the model. Prior research finds that competitive pressures are correlated with strategic use of IT. For example, Judge and Zeithaml (1992) find that competitive pressures influence the firm's use of information systems. Teo et al. (2003) find that mimetic pressure (the tendency to imitate the practice of other firms as a response to uncertainty), coercive pressure (conforming to institutionalized organizing templates) and normative pressure (adherence to norms and standards of professional associations) significantly influence the adoption of financial electronic data interchange. Xue et al. (2008) argue that competitive pressures compel firms to invest more in IT. Thus, we include competitive pressure (representing mimetic, coercive, and normative pressures) as a control variable in the model. As depicted in Figure 1, the competitive pressure should positively influence the firm's strategic use of IT.

Four items representing competitive pressures adapted from Teo et al. (2003) and Liang et al. (2007) are measured using a 7 point Likert-type scale ranging from strongly disagree to strongly agree. Participants were asked to indicate whether investment in technology is driven by: the type of technology competitors use (mimetic); the need to improve regulatory compliance (coercive); the need to be compatible with major suppliers (normative); and the needs of major customers (normative).¹4

## IV. Results

### Descriptive Statistics

Table 1 presents the descriptive statistics of the participants based on the industry (panel A), current position (panel B), type of firm (panel C), firm size (panel D), and risk management and/or quality control frameworks implemented in the organization (panel E). The majority of participants are from various service industries (29.3 percent), followed by technology (18.6 percent), healthcare (16.7 percent) and banking (12.0 percent). Approximately 66.5 percent of the participants are IT managers or senior AIS executives (i.e., chief information officer [CIO] or chief technology officer [CTO]) and 24 participants (11.2 percent) are consultants. The remaining participants have various AIS-related job titles such as systems analyst, internal/external IT auditor, database administrator, business analyst, IT governance manager, and IT security officer. A majority (53.9 percent) of participants work for a private company with 30.4 percent at a publicly traded company; the remainder work for a government or non-profit entity.

Panel D indicates that the majority of participants (67 percent) represent large firms with more than 1,000 employees. Only 19 participants (8.8 percent) work for a firm with fewer than 100 employees. The COSO Enterprise Risk Management (78 participants) and ISO 27001 (55 participants) are the most commonly used risk management and quality control framework, respectively. Further, 41 participants indicated that their firm has not implemented any framework.

[Insert Table 1 about here]

Table 2 presents descriptive statistics based on demographic information. As indicated in panel A, 190 participants are males (88.4 percent). The majority (78.2 percent) have more than 15 years of IT-related work experience as represented in panel B. Panel C reports that 48.9 percent have completed some post-graduate work. All but eight have completed at least an undergraduate degree. Panel D reports that 112 participants have an information systems or computer science related background.

[Insert Table 2 about here]

Next, we determine whether the maturity of IT risk management practices (the mean score of each of the 19 items) differs by industry, firm type (i.e., public, private, government, etc.), and firm size. ANOVA results indicate there are no significant differences in the maturity of IT risk management practices between industries (untabulated; F=1.135, p=0.340), firm type (untabulated; F=0.120, p=0.975), or firm size (untabulated; F=0.588, p=0.444).

### Hypothesis Testing

We analyze the relationship between the independent variables (board involvement, board expertise, and risk culture) and the dependent variable (maturity of IT risk management practices) using LISREL 9.20.¹5 The initial analysis of the measurement model indicates that all factor loadings (ranging from 0.71 to 0.96) are significant (p < 0.05). The composite reliability scores (average variance extracted) for board involvement, board expertise, risk culture, and maturity are 0.90 (0.75), 0.95 (0.86), 0.80 (0.65), and 0.86 (0.61), respectively.¹6

We analyze a structural model for board involvement, board expertise, and risk culture association with maturity (Figure 2). The reported ?² for the model is 99.30 (n=215, p < 0.000) with 49 degrees of freedom.¹7 The reported fit indices (RMSEA, NFI, CFI, GFI, and SRMR) are 0.07 (90 percent confidence interval between 0.05 and 0.09), 0.95, 0.97, 0.93, and 0.12, respectively. Overall, 26.9 percent of the variance in maturity is explained by the three independent variables. As hypothesis 1 predicts, there is a positive relationship between board involvement and the maturity (0.12, t=2.26, p<0.05). Related to hypothesis 2, IT expertise at the board level is not significantly related to maturity (0.03, t=0.64, p>0.05). Further, the path leading from risk culture to the maturity of IT risk management practices indicates a significant negative relationship (i.e., IT risk management practices are less mature for firms where management displays more risk taking behavior), supporting the third hypothesis (-0.38, t=-4.92, p<0.05).

[Insert Figure 2 about here]

To explore the non-significant relationship between IT expertise and maturity, we conduct separate path analyses on board involvement, board expertise, and risk culture and their relationship to maturity (untabulated). We find that the maturity and board involvement (0.23, t=4.68, p<0.05) are positively related. Board involvement explains 13 percent of variance in maturity. Further, board expertise has a significant positive association (0.15, t=3.98, p<0.05) with maturity and explains 9.1 percent of the variance. As expected, risk culture has a significant negative association with maturity (-0.51, t=-6.45, p<0.05) and explains 33.4 percent of variance.¹8 Taken together, these results suggest that even though board involvement, expertise and risk culture individually influence maturity, board level expertise may not be as important when the board is involved.¹?

Finally, we analyze the full model as shown in Figure 3. The ?² statistic is 382.08 with 161 degrees of freedom. The reported RMSEA, NFI, CFI, GFI, and SRMR are 0.08 (90 percent confidence interval between 0.06 and 0.09), 0.85, 0.91, 0.87, and 0.20, respectively, and these indicate that the model has a fair fit (MacCallum et al. 1996). The main findings on board involvement, board IT expertise and risk culture do not change after including the control variables. The path leading from strategic use of IT to the maturity is negative and significant (-0.45, t=-2.07, p<0.05). Our findings don't support the commonly-held belief discussed earlier that a firm's IT risk management practices become more mature as IT use increases. A possible explanation is that the firms' IT risk management practices cannot keep up when there are rapid changes in technology. Additionally, the path leading from IT risk exposure to maturity is not significant (0.33, t= 1.02, p>0.05). This finding is consistent with the result that IT risk management practices are not keeping pace with the increases in IT risk exposure. As expected, the path leading from maturity to IT risk exposure has a significant, negative relationship (-1.09, t=-6.72). This result suggests that as the maturity increases, the IT risk exposure is lower. Further, as prior research suggests, competitive environment positively influences the use of IT (0.70, t=7.55, p<0.05).²°

### Additional Analysis

We conduct additional, untabulated analyses in order to provide more evidence of our initial findings. First, we limit the sample to U.S. responses (n=181). The results and inferences we make from them are qualitatively similar as those reported above.

Second, we observe whether board IT expertise, board involvement, and risk culture influences are different for the two categories of IT risks: benefit/value enablement and operations/service delivery.²¹ Board expertise does not influence the maturity of either type of risk (-0.01, t=-0.24, p>0.05 for benefit/value enablement and -0.01, t=-0.26, p>0.05 for operations/service delivery). Further, board involvement positively influences the maturity of both benefit/value enablement (0.13, t=2.47, p<0.05) and operations/service delivery (0.19, t=3.16, p<0.05) risk management practices. Risk culture negatively influences the maturity of both types of IT risk management practices (-0.49, t=-5.85, p<0.05 for benefit/value enablement and -0.49, t=-5.80, p<0.05 for operations/service delivery). These findings are consistent with the earlier results.

Third, we examine whether maturity differs based on which board level committee has the oversight responsibility (overall board, audit committee, risk committee, or technology committee). ANOVA results indicate that maturity does not differ based on whether the risk oversight responsibility lies with the overall board or a board level committee (n=175; F=1.325;p=0.268).²² However, the maturity is higher (t=2.175, one-tailed; p=0.015) when the risk oversight responsibility lies with a board level committee (mean=5.522), rather than a management committee (mean=4.850).²³

Fourth, we test whether board involvement has an impact on the risk culture of the firm. We free the path from board involvement to risk culture and find a significant negative relationship (-0.31, t=-5.45, p<0.05). We find evidence to support the accepted notion that when the board is more involved, management is less likely to engage in risk taking behavior.²4

Finally, we free the paths leading from board IT expertise, board involvement, and risk culture to strategic use of IT. Since technology can provide a competitive advantage for the firm, we explore whether board and management level variables are associated with the firm's level of IT usage. However, we find no significant associations between strategic use of IT and board involvement (0.05, t=1.12), expertise (0.01, t=0.36), and risk culture (0.03, t=0.45). These results suggest that the firm's use of IT may not receive sufficient attention. However, we find that a firm's use of IT is driven by its competitive environment (i.e. the industry, customer, supplier, regulatory requirements). Taken together we can conjecture that the driving force behind IT use in a firm is its competitive pressures from customers, suppliers, industry, industry and regulators.

## V. Conclusion

As a result of the SEC's enhanced proxy disclosure requirements, risk management and oversight has become a major concern among regulators, boards of directors, and management. Further, the increase in cybersecurity incidents and the advances in technology have highlighted the need for oversight of risks associated with IT. However, surveys from professional service firms indicate that there is a concern on the willingness and ability of current boards of directors to provide satisfactory oversight of IT risk management (e.g., PwC 2013). Therefore, we explore whether the board involvement, board IT expertise, and risk culture influence the maturity of a firm's IT risk management practices.

We survey senior IT professionals regarding perceptions of the maturity of IT risk management practices, board involvement, board IT expertise, risk culture, risk exposure, Strategic use of IT, and competitive pressures. The results suggest that board involvement and board IT expertise positively influence the maturity of IT risk management practices. However, we find that board involvement is more important to IT risk management than board IT expertise. As a result of increased cybersecurity incidents, governance experts continue to advocate for more IT expertise at the board level (Czarnecki 2015). However, our results indicate that lack of expertise at the board level can be mitigated by board involvement in IT risk oversight. This result is important to regulators and investors who want to understand the level of expertise of the board in its oversight role. Boards have the ability to call in subject area experts and thus do not necessarily have to have all expertise in-house. Our research suggests that direct board expertise is less important than involvement. Thus, non-expert board members, who are adequately involved in oversight, may be sufficiently qualified to address IT risk concerns.

Additionally, we find that risk culture (i.e. risk-taking behavior) is negatively associated with the maturity of IT risk management practices. Even though, risk taking can create a competitive advantage for the firm, we find lower maturity of risk management practices if managers engage in risk taking behaviors. We also find that the maturity of IT risk management practices is negatively associated with strategic use of IT, which suggests that IT risk management practices are not keeping pace with the level of technology in use. Even though this finding is expected due to rapid technological advances, the slow response to risk management raises concerns. Our results suggest that risky behavior with respect to IT on the part of management needs to be carefully monitored in order to minimize negative consequences. For firms that score highly on strategic use of IT, even greater monitoring is needed.

Further, using a univariate analysis, we find that the maturity of IT risk management practices does not differ among firms that delegate the risk oversight to various board level committees (overall board, audit committee, risk committee, technology committee). However, the maturity is lower when the risk oversight responsibility lies with a management committee rather than at the board level. This finding provides some guidance on the appropriate governance structure for oversight of IT risk.

This study answers a call for further ITG research by Wilkin and Chenhall (2010). We also apply the theory of achievement motivation to explain management behavior in IT risk management. Further, we contribute to the literature by providing a parsimonious model that explore the impact of management and board level variables on IT risk management that can be extended to enterprise risk management.

Further, our findings inform regulators on how board oversight impacts IT risk management practices. Consequently, regulators may be interested in further exploring whether enhanced disclosure requirements on the oversight role of the board needs to be extended to include specific mandates to discuss IT risk. Also, we contribute to practice by addressing where IT risk oversight responsibility should be delegated at the board level. We find that board involvement is more important than having an IT expert at the board, and board committees, regardless of the type, has a larger effect on maturity than management committees. Given the significant discussion of IT breaches in the business press and the concerns of regulators as to the role of the board in IT risk oversight, our study makes an important early step in identifying the appropriate governance structure for addressing IT risk.

There are several limitations to this study. First, our participants are from large firms and the majority are from organizations that are not publicly traded, thus our findings may not be generalizable. Second, we analyze perceptions of the participants, which may differ from what others perceive and what may be happening in reality. Third, this study is subject to response bias. Fourth, the limited sample size restricts our analysis.

Wilken and Chenhall (2010) identify five of aspects of ITG including strategy alignment, resource management, value delivery, and performance measurement. We examine one: risk management. Future research could explore how board involvement and expertise hold for the other aspects of ITG they identify. Given the rapid changes in technology, we need to further explore whether IT use is a function of board and management decisions or whether it is driven by market forces. Further, future research could explore whether maturity of one type of risk influences the maturity of other types of risks.

¹ The SEC Release Nos. 33-9089; 34-61175; IC-29092; File No. S7-13-09 (available at http://www.sec.gov/news/press/2009/2009-268.htm), which are based on the final proxy disclosure enhancements rules. This was a new disclosure requirement for Item 407 of Regulation S-K and a corresponding amendment to Item 7 of Schedule 14A.

² ISACA (2009a, p.11) defines IT risk as "the business risk associated with the use, ownership, operation, involvement, influence and adoption of IT within an enterprise, consisting of IT-related events and conditions that could potentially impact the business. It can occur with both uncertain frequency and magnitude, and it creates challenges in meeting strategic goals and objectives." Hence, IT risk management practices are a collection of processes, policies, and procedures followed to mitigate IT risks.

³ For example, recent cyberattacks on Target, JP Morgan Chase, Equifax, and others have further heighten the need to consider IT risk management practices.

4 We recognize that maturity has other dimensions such as the quality of IT risk management capabilities and the extent to which these practices have been formalized; however, we argue that the extent to which these practices are conducted correlates with quality and formalization. As a process becomes more formalized the process becomes more mature leading to mature management practices.

5 See Andriole (2009) and Jewer and McKay (2012) for a detailed list of prescriptive versus descriptive research on board involvement in IT governance.

6 SEC disclosures required by Sections 406 and 407 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (2002) [RELEASE NOS. 33-8177; 34-47235; File No. S7-40-02] defines a financial expert as a person who has a thorough understanding of the audit committee's oversight role, expertise in accounting matters as well as understanding of financial statements, and the ability to ask the right questions to determine whether the company's financial statements are complete and accurate.

7 Wilkin and Chenhall (2010) identify five areas of ITG namely: 1. strategic alignment aligning IT strategy with business strategy; 2. risk management; 3. resource management formulating, implementing, and adhering to tactical plans for aligning IT strategy with business strategy; 4. value delivery- identifying the benefit net of cost while considering risk; and 5. performance measurement-measuring performance of IT projects.

8 For example, managers who are more risk taking will allow employees to bring their own device to work to increase productivity even though it may pose a significant IT risk. As a result, a firm with a bring your own device policy may have less control over their IT assets, data, security, etc.

? The three broad categories of IT risks identified in the Risk IT Framework (ISACA 2009a) are: 1) IT benefit/value enablement- risks associated with missed opportunities to use technology to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of business processes; 2) IT program/project delivery - risks associated with quality, relevance and overrun of projects which ties into IT investment portfolio management; and 3) IT operations and service delivery risks - risks associated with the performance of IT systems and services such as service interruptions, compliance, and security. Since the IT program/project delivery risk category relates to specific projects, and extensive research on project management risk management is available (e.g., Taylor et al. 2012), we eliminate this risk category from our study.

¹° We are interested in the association among groups rather than their differences. Our decision on the most appropriate measurement scale for these items is consistent with guidance given by Kline (2011). Further, gathering the board's actual knowledge of IT is not feasible, because the survey instrument is distributed to managers; thus, we use manager perceptions of board level IT expertise for this study.

¹¹ Likert type scale points are as follows; 1= strongly disagree, 2=moderately disagree, 3= slightly disagree, 4=neither agree nor disagree, 5= slightly agree, 6= moderately agree, and 7= strongly agree.

¹² Two out of three items were reverse coded.

¹³ Nolan and McFarlan (2005) provide 14 items in their IT strategic impact grid. Seven items represent the reliability of the system and seven items represent the strategic use of IT. We use the six items that depict the strategic use of IT. One item was eliminated as it did not load as expected on the strategic use of IT construct. To maintain parsimony of our model, based on Hall et.al (1999) suggestion, we further factor analyzed the six items to construct parcels. The final construct is measured using two parcels. See Appendix for items belonging to each parcel.

¹4 Cronbach's alphas for the items used to measure board IT expertise, board involvement, risk culture and maturity are 0.95, 0.90, 0.79 and 0.93, respectively. Cronbach's alphas used for the IT risk exposure, strategic use of IT and competitive pressure control variables items are 0.89, 0.77, and 0.73, respectively. Nunnally (1978) suggests Cronbach alpha measures of 0.7 or higher for new measures.

¹5 Since the sample size is small relative to the number of indicators, we aggregate the 19 indicators for maturity into four parcels based on a factor analysis. Little et al. (2002) defines a parcel as an aggregate-level indicator comprised of the sum (or average) of two or more items. Begozzi and Edwards (1998) show that aggregating individual items into parcels and using the parcels may be appropriate in structural modelling. Further Little et al. (2002) suggest that when a construct is multidimensional, parceling can help achieve parsimony, reduce sampling errors, and improve model fit. Since the parceling technique is used in prior accounting research (see Henri 2006 and Carrington et al. 2013), we adapt this technique and follow item parceling strategies recommended by Hall et al. (1999) and Little et al. (2002). An exploratory factor analysis on the 19 items finds four underlying constructs related to the benefit/value enablement and operations/service delivery IT risk management practice categories. We name these four constructs vision, communication, operations and monitoring related IT risk management practices. We eliminate four (out of 19) items as they do not clearly reflect (load on) one of the four constructs mentioned above leaving 15 items (see Appendix for items belonging to each parcel). The four parcels related to vision, communications, operations, and monitoring related IT risk management practices are used as four indicator variables reflecting maturity.

¹6 Hair et al. (2010) recommend composite reliability scores above 0.70 and an average variance extracted above the 0.50 to indicate reliability and convergent validity, respectively.

¹7 Carmies and McIver (1981) state that a model has an acceptable fit if the ?2/df <3. Our model's ratio is 2.02.

¹8 The reported fit indices for the three individual models (board involvement, board expertise and risk culture) are: ?² (15.98, 15.37, and 15.13); df (13, 13, and 8); RMSEA (0.03, 0.03, and 0.06); NFI (0.98, 0.98, and 0.97); CFI (0.99, 0.99, and 0.98); GFI (0.98, 0.98, and 0.98), and SRMR (0.03 for all three models), respectively. The accepted thresholds for RMSEA is <0.08 and >0.90 for NFI, CFI, and GFI (Hair et al. 2010).

¹? The authors discussed this topic with the audit committee chairs of two Fortune 1000 companies. One director noted it would be difficult to obtain an expert in all aspects of IT as there are many facets (e.g. use in product development or IT use in the operations of the company). Also, the domain changes rapidly making it difficult for one board member to maintain an expertise across a broad spectrum of areas. Both directors agreed that IT is so complex that the best option is often to hire a subject matter expert to educate and advise the board when needed.

²° Alternatively, we analyze the hypotheses using regression analysis. Even though, the complex path model with latent constructs cannot be observed in a regression analysis, we can observe simple associations between IT risk management practices and IT risk exposure, strategic use of IT, risk culture, board involvement, and board expertise. The adjusted R-squared is 35.9 percent. These results suggest that a substantial percent of a firm's IT risk management practices can be explained by our chosen variables. The overall model is significant (f=25.13; p<0.000). All coefficients (untabulated) are significant (p<0.10), except for board expertise (p=0.590).

²¹ The model reports a ?2 statistic of 198.74 with 46 degrees of freedom. The reported fit indices (RMSEA=0.12 [90 percent confidence interval between 0.10 and 0.14]; NFI=0.89; CFI=0.91; GFI=0.88; and SRMR=0.15) indicate the model is adequate.

²² We eliminated responses with "don't know (n=28)" and "management (n=13)" response categories.

²³ We examine management versus board level oversight using a one-tailed t-test. Stewardship theory suggests that board oversight will positively influence management to prioritize activities. Thus, based on this argument, we have a priori expectations that when oversight is at the board level, maturity will be greater.

²4 Model fit indices are as follows: ?²=70.38, df=49, RMSEA=0.04, NFI=0.96, CFI=0.98, GFI=0.94, SRMR=0.04
