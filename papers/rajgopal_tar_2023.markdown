### ABSTRACT
Despite regulators' allegations that digital technology giants misuse their market power to earn abnormal profits, there is a dearth of systematic work on (1) whether digital-tech firms in general, and tech giants in particular, earn excess profits or (2) whether their abnormal profitability, if any, is due to market power. We use two alternative measures of economic profitability in addition to accounting rate of return (ARR): internal rate of return (IRR), which equates current investments to their long-term payback, and return on invested capital (ROIC), whose numerator (profits) and denominator (invested capital) are adjusted for capitalized intangibles. Inferences based on IRRs differ from those based on ARRs and ROICs. IRRs show that the digital-tech sector is now the best-performing sector, and its gap between profitability and cost of capital has increased over time. We are unable to separate the contribution of market power and innovation to digital tech's high IRRs.

### I. INTRODUCTION
Regulatory authorities in the United States, European Union (EU), and Australia have alleged that digital giants, such as Alphabet (the parent company of Google) and Amazon, misuse their market power to engage in anticompetitive practices.<sup>1</sup> However, systematic research that documents higher profitability of digital technology firms and its relationship with anticompetitive practices, if any, is limited. Grullon, Larkin, and Michaely (2019) find that the return on assets (ROA) of the technology industry has increased over time. The Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) (2016) makes a similar point, relying on a measure akin to return on invested capital (ROIC). Loecker, Eeckhout, and Unger (2020) show that increased market power is associated with higher price markups over costs. None of these studies focus on digital technology firms, arguably because measuring their economic profits is nontrivially difficult, and concepts such as price markups or the excess of revenues over cost of goods sold (COGS) are not clearly defined for technology firms.

The difficulty of measuring profitability of digital technology firms, or firms that rely heavily on intangibles, stems from the U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) requirement for immediate expensing of in-house research and development (R&D) and other intangible outlays. These outlays, reported in selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expenses, include investments in innovation, product development, process improvement, information technology, organizational strategy, hiring and training personnel, customer acquisition, and brand development as well as funds used for wringing efficiencies from firms' peer and supplier networks. The immediate expensing of intangible outlays distorts the matching of revenues with expenses and affects the validity of concepts, such as profit and profit margins, while increasing the volatility of measured profits for firms that make unequal intangible investments over time (Dichev and Tang 2009; Srivastava 2014). Imagine what the profitability would look like if a growing manufacturing firm immediately expensed property, plant, and equipment (PP&E) investments. In a similar vein, a high-growth technology firm that earns large economic profits could still report huge losses if it makes value-added intangible investments.

Muddying the picture is a contrary claim that companies such as Amazon, Microsoft, and Netflix sell their products and services below cost to eliminate competition and, hence, are willing to incur large operational losses. In such a case, a dominant technology firm's low profitability could reflect predatory behavior that would pay off in subsequent periods. Again, ROA, based on a single-period payoff, would inaccurately represent the economic profitability of intangible investments in the technology sector.

We adopt a two-part approach in this study. In the first part, we offer stylized evidence on the economic profitability of the digital technology sector and its changes over time using alternative profitability measures. We also present results for other industries to enable cross-sectional benchmarking and intertemporal comparisons over four decades (1980s, 1990s, 2000s, and 2010s). In the second part, we separately examine the economic profitability of digital giants, defined as digital-tech firms with market capitalization in excess of $950 billion as of December 31, 2021 (Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, and Facebook [now Meta]), to mirror regulatory and popular concerns that they pursue anticompetitive strategies and earn abnormal profits.

Our main contribution is reintroduction of an alternative method of measurement to overcome the limitations of accounting rate of return (ARR) in assessing the profitability of a modern technology company.<sup>2</sup> In a seminal American Economic Review piece, Fisher and McGowan (1983) show that ARR (which is broadly ROA) is not a good proxy for economic returns for growth firms. Our evidence is primarily based on internal rate of return (IRR), defined as the discount rate that equates investments with related cash payouts following Fisher and McGowan (1983) and Baber and Kang (1996).

We calculate IRRs by first computing a cash recovery rate (CRR) each year following Baber and Kang (1996). Baber and Kang (1996) evaluated the economic profitability of the pharmaceutical industry in a study commissioned by the U.S. Congress Office of Technology Assessment; they drew on Ijiri (1978, 1979, 1980) and Salamon (1982, 1985). Following these studies, we construct CRR as cash recovery in a year divided by the amount of invested capital at the beginning of that year. To compute cash recovery, we start with after-tax operating income and then add back depreciation and amortization expenses, subtract changes in noncash working capital, and add proceeds from the sale of invested capital, if any. We also add back the investment portion of that year's R&D and MainSG&A (defined as SG&A excluding R&D), which we estimate for each industry using the following two alternative models: the Revenue-to-Intangibles model and the Price-to-Book Value model.<sup>3</sup> Invested capital is enhanced by adding to book value of invested capital the accumulated depreciation, making it somewhat agnostic to accounting policies related to depreciation. We also add the running totals of the previous years' investment R&D and MainSG&A, with the number of accumulation years defined as the useful lives estimated by the Revenue-to-Intangibles and the Price-to-Book Value models.

<sup>2</sup> ARR is measured by dividing operating income after tax by invested capital, which is the sum of long-term debt, preferred stock, noncontrolling interest, and common equity.  
<sup>3</sup> We follow Iqbal et al. (2022) to simultaneously estimate (1) the percentages of R&D and MainSG&A to be capitalized and (2) their useful lives over which the capitalized values should be amortized. This method is based on the regression model that maximizes the association of these expenditures with future benefits, proxied by revenues. In separate models for R&D and MainSG&A, we include up to seven years of future revenues for R&D and by the two years of future revenues for SG&D. The models of the R&D and MainSG&A, we include up to seven years of future revenues for R&D and the highest adjusted R². We refer to this model as the Revenue-to-Intangibles model and provide details in Appendix A. Our results are robust to an alternative Price-to-Book Value model following Lev, Nissim, and Thomas (2008), the results of which are provided in Appendix A1.

Capitalizing the investment portions of R&D and MainSG&A and unwinding the depreciation of tangible assets increase the numerator related to cash recoveries as well as the denominator of invested capital.

We rely on an algorithm that stipulates that for each unique set of CRRs over a given payout period and an investment growth rate, a unique IRR exists. Following Salamon (1982), we make assumptions about the payback profile, that is, how long it takes to pay back an investment and what percentage of that payback occurs in each future period. We thus compute the implied IRR or the discount rate that equates cash recoveries over the payback period to the initial investments. We conduct sensitivity tests with different payback periods and different capitalization schemes. While the IRR calculations are sensitive to these assumptions, the rankings of the IRRs of firms and industries are robust to such alternative assumptions (Salamon 1982, 1985; Lee and Stark 1987; Gordon and Hamer 1988; Griner and Stark 1988).

We also estimate an ROIC measure that incorporates capitalization of intangibles.<sup>4</sup> We adjust the numerator and denominator for the investment percentages and amortization rates of R&D and MainSG&A, with both parameters estimated using the Revenue-to-Intangibles and the Price-to-Book Value models. We add back an after-tax effect of net investments in intangible investments to earnings. The stock of R&D and MainSG&A (to the extent not amortized) is added to the denominator to obtain modified invested capital. ROIC, which is the modified numerator divided by the modified denominator, is easier to implement than IRR and is hence a popular measure. However, this ROIC measure cannot overcome an important limitation of accounting-based profitability, which is that it cannot match investments to their payback periods.

Our analysis also suggests that IRR will not dominate ARR in measuring economic profitability in all contexts. For example, companies with stable technologies and mature operations could have developed reliable forecasts of the useful lives of physical assets. In those cases, continuing to carry undepreciated assets in the denominator while not deducting the depreciation expense in the numerator would introduce errors in calculating performance measures such as IRR.

We select our sample from firms covered by Compustat and the Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP) between 1980 and 2019, a period that witnessed rapid technological change. We retain firm-years with more than $100 million in inflation-adjusted assets (adjusted to the year 2000) to focus on only economically important firms (Dichev and Tang 2009). We then categorize firms as low technology, stable technology, or high technology based on the first six digits of their Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) codes. We isolate health-tech (biotechnology and pharmaceutical firms) from high-tech firms and label the remaining firms as members of the digital-tech sector.

We begin our analysis by computing accounting rates of return from 1980 to 2019 separately for four decades (the 1980s [1980–1989], 1990s [1990–1999], 2000s [2000–2009], and 2010s [2010–2019]). Based on weighted average ARR (weighted by beginning market value of equity), health tech was the best-performing sector during the first three of the four decades we examine, which was likely because health-tech firms, which have long survived and become large firms, now report large profits despite R&D expensing and have a low asset base because of R&D expensing. Their dominance peters out in the latest decade. From 2010 to 2019, low tech emerged as the best-performing sector, with relatively stable ARRs of about 18 percent. This is surprising given the popular perception that low-tech firms have struggled recently, at least in the prepandemic period. At the very least, hardly anyone alleges that low-tech firms earn supernormal profits. Notably, digital tech is not the best performer in any decade. Among digital giants, Amazon reports negative ARRs in its earlier existence and earns an ARR of less than 12 percent even in the 2010–2019 decade, during which time it allegedly indulged in anticompetitive practices. The ROIC measure reports similar results. Health tech was the best-performing sector in the first three of the four decades, and low tech was the best-performing sector in the 2010s.

IRRs, our preferred measure, tell a different story. While the exact results differ slightly based on the assumptions used to estimate parameters for IRRs, three conclusions about relative rankings over time and in a cross-section remain the same. First, the digital-tech sector’s profitability has increased over time. Digital tech is also the only sector that reports improvement in performance over time. Second, it was the best-performing sector in the 2010–2019 decade and the second best during the 2000–2009 decade, consistent with investor perceptions reflected in the digital-tech sector’s run-up in stock prices. Third, because cost of capital declined during the 21st century, primarily due to a fall in Treasury yields, the gap between IRRs of the digital-tech firms and their cost of capital dramatically widened. Furthermore, the digital-tech sector not only outperformed the low-tech and stable-tech sectors but also outperformed with an overwhelming margin.

The most notable outperformers are the digital giants. In the 2010s, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, and Apple each reported IRRs exceeding 40 percent. Alphabet’s IRR was close to 40 percent in the 2000–2009 decade but has declined since. In all cases except Facebook, estimated IRRs were at least twice that of ROICs. ROIC does not reflect superior performance for any of the digital giants. For three of five companies examined (Alphabet, Microsoft, and Apple), estimated ROIC is less than ARR, likely because capitalization of intangibles increased the denominator more than the numerator. Thus, even ROIC fails to detect digital-tech firms’ high profitability, if any. IRRs clearly present a different and, arguably, more accurate picture of profitability for digital giants than those depicted by ARR or ROIC.

As a validation test, IRR is more strongly associated with contemporaneous stock returns than ARR or ROIC, at least for the health-tech and digital-tech sectors in the 2000s and 2010s. Furthermore, IRR dominates ARR and ROIC in its explanatory power for Tobin’s q in almost every period and sector. Nevertheless, ARR dominates IRR in explaining contemporaneous stock returns for the low-tech sector, that is, for firms with low intangibles.

One tentative interpretation of our findings is that digital giants use their dominant positions to indulge in anticompetitive practices and earn abnormally high profits. Another interpretation is that technology firms have harnessed unprecedented innovation and productivity to reap large profits. We conduct a battery of tests but cannot distinguish between these two explanations. We first consider the following two measures of product market power that are proxies for anticompetitive behavior (Hoberg and Phillips 2016): total product similarity (TSIMM) and product market concentration (HHI). In addition, we obtain two measures of technological innovation (Kogan, Papanikolaou, Seru, and Stoffman 2017), as follows: scientific value (SCIVALUE) and economic value (ECOVALUE). Abnormal profitability of the digital giants is associated with proxies for both market power and technological innovation, making it difficult for us to conclude which factor dominates. We also investigate how the market reacts to news reports of regulators’ antitrust actions against digital giants, following Bittlingmayer and Hazlett (2000). If competitors are hurt by digital giants’ anticompetitive behavior, then they should benefit from the news about antitrust enforcements, and their stock prices should increase on the dates of antitrust announcements. The data suggest that competitors are not hurt by such news, thus casting some doubt on the antitrust hypothesis.

### II. ALTERNATIVE MEASURES OF ECONOMIC PROFITABILITY
Fisher and McGowan (1983) define the economic rate of return on an investment as the discount rate that equates the cash benefits to its initial outlay. They go on to highlight that ARR, which is basically ROA, fails to capture economic return on an investment for four reasons.<sup>5</sup> First, financial reporting depreciation schedules, especially the straight-line method most commonly inherent in ARR, rarely reflect the stream of benefits coming from an investment. Second, ARRs are reported for the firm as a whole and, by definition, would be an average of the ARRs for individual investments made in the past.<sup>6</sup> The weights in that average would consist of the book values of those different investments, which in turn depend on the depreciation schedule adopted and, particularly, on the amount and timing of such investments. Third, unless a few very restrictive assumptions hold (for example, the mix of different types of assets, each with a unique time distribution of future benefits, remains fixed every year, the firm grows at the same rate, and investments increase in those specific assets by the same proportion every year), ARR to the firm as a whole would not be constant and would not equal the economic rate of return. Fourth, only when the ARR equals the growth rate of investment would the economic rate of return be the ARR.

Nevertheless, critics remain uncomfortable with IRR because it is based on several assumptions about the length and time distribution of benefits generated by investments and the growth rate of investments (as elaborated on in Appendix A). Yet, critics ignore that ARRs rely on an even greater number of assumptions, including the capitalization or expensing of investment outlays (physical versus intangibles, acquired versus self-developed), revenue recognition, conservative accounting such as impairments and restructuring charges, and depreciation policy. The only difference is that a researcher makes the assumptions in calculating IRRs, while ARRs are based on accounting numbers derived from numerous conventions and managers’ assumptions.

We do not claim that ARRs are irrelevant. On the contrary, we argue that for firms with stable and mature operations, when managers can accurately estimate items such as economic depreciation, ARR will be a better estimate of performance than a measure that ignores that information. We reason that IRR can offer a different perspective from ARR, at least in instances in which ARR suffers from known limitations, particularly in measuring economic profitability of digital-tech firms that rely heavily on intangible investments. A researcher’s estimates of useful lives of intangibles and ex post incorporation of payback from growth options, even if inaccurate, would provide better estimates than altogether ignoring the question of useful lives of intangibles.

We rely on the Baber and Kang (1996) version of the IRR estimation. The method, pioneered by Ijiri (1978, 1979, 1980) and Salamon (1982, 1985), calculates a cash recovery rate from accounting data, which can then be combined with assumptions about the time profile of cash flows to infer an IRR for the industry. The details of IRR calculation are described in Appendix A. In addition to ARR and IRR, we calculate ROIC for comparison (see Appendix C). Recent finance literature and the popular press rely on ROIC as a measure of economic profitability, as ROIC is easier to implement and calculate than IRR. ROIC mitigates at least some deficiencies in ARR calculation by incorporating intangible investments and the spirit of their economic depreciation. However, the popular version of ROIC continues to suffer from many limitations of ARR, with the most important being that it does not match investments to their payback periods.

### III. SAMPLE SELECTION AND DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS

#### Sample
Our sample period spans 40 years between 1980 and 2019 and includes firm-years covered by Compustat and CRSP with $100 million in inflation-adjusted assets (adjusted to year 2000 values) following Dichev and Tang (2009).<sup>7</sup> Table 1 presents our key sample selection steps. We start with 372,765 firm-year observations covered in the Compustat North America Fundamentals Annual database during 1980–2019 and remove 113,571 observations related to firms in the utilities, financials, and real estate sectors (firms with two-digit GICS codes 40, 55, and 60) and firms with missing GICS codes. We then remove 83,337 firm-years without CRSP coverage or firm-years whose fiscal years end before the first date for which stock price data are on CRSP. Next, we remove 82,165 observations with either inflation-adjusted assets less than $100 million or missing beginning market value of equity (stock price at the end of the fiscal year × common shares outstanding), resulting in 93,692 observations before we impose additional data requirements for key variables used in our analyses. From this preliminary sample, we drop 547 observations with insufficient data to calculate accounting rate of return or return on invested capital and another 4,520 observations with less than six years of data in Compustat to calculate internal rate of return.<sup>8</sup> These data requirements result in 88,625 firm-year observations for 8,408 unique firms in our main analyses. Sample sizes used in other analyses vary due to additional data filters.

After applying the sample filters, we classify firms as low technology, stable technology, or high technology based on the first six digits of their GICS codes using the definitions outlined in Mizik and Jacobson (2003), Chandler (1994), and Chan, Martin, and Kensinger (1990).<sup>9</sup> See Appendix B for industry classification. Low-tech firms represent the food, beverage, retail, hospitality, and consumer durables industries. Stable-tech firms operate primarily in industries related to transportation, automobiles, chemicals, energy, equipment, and machinery. We subdivide high-technology firms into the health-tech sector (health care equipment and services, pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, and life sciences) and the digital-tech sector (information technology and communication services). Untabulated results show that the number of digital-tech firms with inflation-adjusted total assets exceeding $100 million increased significantly during the 1990s, coinciding with the dotcom boom.

#### Descriptive Statistics
Table 2 presents descriptive statistics of key variables for our sample firms. ARR ranges from 3.3 percent at the first quartile to 15.6 percent at the third quartile with a mean (median) of 8.3 percent (9.5 percent). We vary the cash payback period and present the IRRs calculated under the assumptions of six, eight, and ten years as the payback period. We compare IRRs for different industry sectors, calculated with a common assumption about payback periods. Otherwise, the comparisons are not valid.

We present key variables used in ROIC and IRR calculations. The mean (median) ROIC is 9.3 percent (8.5 percent). The mean value of CF (the numerator for CRR) is $1.058 billion, and the mean gross value of INVESTMENT (the denominator for CRR) is $5.203 billion. The mean CRR is 0.225, and the mean geometric growth rate (G) of investment is 1.155.

<sup>7</sup> We obtain monthly Consumer Price Index data for all urban consumers from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics for inflation adjustment.  
<sup>8</sup> We use all Compustat firms with available data in estimating industry-level parameters needed for capitalization and amortization of intangible investments (as described in Appendix A). We also require firms to have at least N number of years to remain in our sample, where N is the cash payout period used in the IRR calculation.  
<sup>9</sup> We use GICS given its popularity among financial practitioners and because it provides a significantly better technique for identifying industry peers than the total taxitions, including the financial and financial classification industry, including the financial and the Fama and French (1997) algorithm (Bhojraj, Lee, and Oler 2003). We exclude financials, utilities, and real estate sectors because of their unique regulatory reporting environments.

Table 2 presents summary statistics for our sample firms from 1980 to 2019. ARR is effectively net operating income after taxes divided by beginning invested capital. ROIC is calculated by modifying the numerator and denominator of the ratio of net income to beginning invested capital to incorporate capitalization and depreciation of intangible investments, as defined in Appendix C. IRR is defined as the discount rate that equates the initial investment with related cash payouts and is estimated under a representative cash payout profile, as described in Appendix A.

### APPENDIX A
#### Calculation Details
##### Revenue-to-Intangibles Model
We follow Iqbal, Rajgopal, Srivastava, and Zhao (2022) to simultaneously estimate the investment portion and the productive life of R&D or MainSG&A based on their associations with future economic benefits proxied by future revenues. In separate models for R&D and SG&A, we include up to seven years of future revenues for R&D and up to five years of future revenues for SG&A.

```
MainSG&A_{i,t} or R&D_{i,t} = α_{Ind} + β_{Ind} × Revenues_{i,t} + ∑_{k=1}^g β_{Ind,k} × Revenues_{i,t+k} + e_{i,t}
```

For each six-digit GICS industry, we select the model that gives the highest adjusted R². Parameter k (i.e., how many years of future revenues are associated with current year intangible investments) from the optimal model is assumed to be the productive life of investment. Parameter estimates from the optimal model are used to calculate the investment portion of R&D or MainSG&A for each firm-year (i.e., investment percent is the intercept plus sum of betas × future revenues, divided by current year R&D or MainSG&A). We calculate the value-weighted average investment portion for each industry, with the weight being the amount of firm-year R&D or MainSG&A. We refer to this model as the Revenue-to-Intangibles model.

##### Calculation of Internal Rate of Return
The calculation of IRR relies on an algorithm stipulating that for each unique cash recovery rate and an investment growth rate over a given payback period, there is a unique IRR (Ijiri 1978, 1979, 1980). To compute cash payouts, we start with after-tax operating income and add back depreciation and amortization.<sup>28</sup> Decreases in noncash working capital and proceeds from the sale of invested capital, if any, are also added back in the numerator to incorporate cash recoveries from any sale of past investment. To adjust for intangible investments, we add back the investment portions of current year R&D and MainSG&A in the numerator as well as the cumulative investment portions of R&D and MainSG&A over the duration of their respective productive lives to invested capital. Thus, gross invested capital is the sum of book value of debt, minority interest, equity, accumulated depreciation and amortization, and capitalized R&D and MainSG&A. In effect, the numerator is a close approximation of cash generated from operations after treating outlays on capitalized R&D and MainSG&A, PP&E, net working capital, and financial assets as investments. The denominator carries all investments (PP&E, working capital, acquisitions, financial assets, and intangible expenditures) at their initial values until the time they are sold or retired. Neither the numerator nor the denominator is affected by revenue recognition and depreciation schedule. For growing companies, R&D and MainSG&A capitalizations increase the numerator representing cash recoveries and the denominator representing invested capital.

We overcome the single-period nature of ARR by making assumptions about the payback period, that is, how long it takes to pay back an investment and what percentage of that payback occurs in each future period, following Salamon (1982). For example, if any investment pays back a total of $12 with a Q1 profile (Fisher and McGowan 1983) spread over N years, then we assume that an N of 9 implies a payback of $0, $0, $0, $1, $2, $3, $3, $2, and $1 in the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, and ninth years, respectively, after the initial investment. This payback assumes a gestation period of three years and a rise in recoveries over the next three years, followed by a decline. If those paybacks follow the Q1 profile and occur with a 20 percent IRR, then, following a $1 investment, the cash flows over the next nine years would be $0, $0, $0, $0.26, $0.53, $0.79, $0.79, $0.53, and $0.26.

We illustrate this methodology using accounting data from Compustat (nominal values) for Amazon with the following assumptions: the investment portion of R&D (MainSG&A) is 100 percent (50 percent), and the productive life of R&D (MainSG&A) is two years (four years).<sup>31</sup> For fiscal year 2019, Amazon’s CF works out to $108,169 million. INVESTMENT at the beginning of the year is $238,198 million, which leads to a CRR of 0.454.<sup>32</sup> The constant investment growth rate, G, is calculated as the geometric mean of year-over-year growth in INVESTMENT from 1997 to 2019 with available data (for Amazon, 57.3 percent or 1.573). Setting G equal to 1.573 (that is, 57.3 percent), CRR equal to 0.454, and a cash payout period of eight years, we obtain a solution of 0.669, which is equal to 1/R. Because R = 1 + IRR, the implied IRR is thus 49.5 percent.

<sup>31</sup> Productive life of two (four) years for R&D (MainSG&A) is estimated under the Price-to-Book Value model.  
<sup>32</sup> The INVESTMENT number is a combination of internal investments and acquisitions. The IRR method is robust enough to handle different payoffs from these two types of investments as long as cash recoveries from either investment occur within our estimated payback period.

### APPENDIX C
#### Variable Definitions

| **Variables** | **Definition (Compustat Variables are in Capital Letters)** |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Calculation of ARR, ROIC, and IRR** | |
| *ARR* | Accounting rate of return, calculated as income before extraordinary items (IB) + minority interest (MII) + after-tax interest expense [XINT × (1 – ETR)], divided by beginning book value of invested capital (ICAPT). ARR is not calculated if IB is missing. |
| *ROIC* | Return on invested capital, calculated by dividing [(earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) + investment portion of R&D (XRD) and MainSG&A – depreciation of capitalized R&D and MainSG&A) × (1 – ETR)] by [invested capital (ICAPT) + undepreciated values of capitalized R&D and MainSG&A]. Capitalized R&D and MainSG&A are amortized over their respective productive lives. If EBIT is missing, it is replaced by operating income after depreciation (OIADP) or sales (SALE) – cost of goods sold (COGS) – SG&A (XSGA) – depreciation expense (DP). |
| *IRR* | Internal rate of return, defined as the discount rate that equates the initial investment with related cash payouts and is estimated under a representative cash payout profile and constant growth rate in investment. Under the profile used in our main analysis, a firm’s total investments generate cash payouts within the next N years with no payouts in the first N/3 years followed by increasing payouts between year N/3 and year 2N/3 and then decreasing payouts from year 2N/3 to the final year, with zero payout in the final year. See Appendix A for details. |
| *CRR* | Cash recovery rate, calculated as cash recovered (CF) divided by beginning gross investments (INVESTMENT). |
| *CF* | Cash recovered, calculated as operating income before depreciation and income tax (OIBDP) + investment portion of R&D (XRD) + investment portion of MainSG&A – income tax (TXT) + deferred income taxes (TXDC) + (–) decrease (increase) in noncash working capital + proceeds from the sale of invested capital. Noncash working capital is current assets (ACT) – cash and short-term investment (CHE) – current liabilities (LCT). Proceeds from the sale of invested capital is from sale of property (SPPE) and sale of investments (SIV). Cash recovered is not calculated if OIBDP is missing. Other variables used in this calculation are treated as 0 if missing. OIBDP, XRD, XSGA, ACT, CHE, LCT, SPPE, and SIV are Compustat variables. |
| *INVESTMENT* | INVESTMENT (Gross), calculated as invested capital (ICAPT) + accumulated depreciation and amortization (DPACT; if DPACT is missing, it is replaced by PPEGT – PPENT) + capitalized R&D and MainSG&A. It is used for calculating CRR. INVESTMENT (Net) is invested capital (ICAPT) + undepreciated portion of capitalized R&D and MainSG&A. INVESTMENT is set to missing for firms with nonpositive ICAPT. It is used for calculating ROIC. |
| *G* | Constant geometric mean in annual investment growth rate over the sample period, where annual growth rate is calculated as INVESTMENT (Gross) at year t divided by INVESTMENT (Gross) at year t–1. |
| *N* | Cash payout period used in the IRR calculation. |
| **Other Variables** | |
| *ACT* | Current assets. |
| *AT* | Total assets. |
| *CAR* | Annual cumulative abnormal return, averaged over the same cash payout period used for IRR calculation. Annual cumulative abnormal return is the sum of monthly abnormal returns obtained from Beta Suite by Wharton Research Data Services (WRDS) estimated under the market model with a window of 60 months and a minimum window of 24 months. |
| *CEQ* | Common / ordinary equity. |
| *CHE* | Cash and short-term investments. |
| *DLTT* | Long-term debt. |
| *DPACT* | Depreciation, depletion, and amortization (accumulated). |
| *EBIT* | Earnings before interest and taxes. |
| *ECOVALUE* | Average economic value of patents. Economic value is based on stock market reactions to patent grants, as calculated in Kogan et al. (2017). |
| *ETR* | Effective tax rate, calculated as income tax expense (TXT) divided by pretax book income (PI) excluding special items (SPI). Winsorized between 0 and 1. For companies with an ETR that cannot be calculated, we assume 35 percent. If pretax book income (excluding special items) is missing, then it is calculated as operating income after depreciation (OIADP) – interest expense (XINT) + nonoperating income (NOPI). |
| *HHI* | Product market concentration or Herfindahl-Hirschman Index sum of squared market shares measure based on Hoberg and Phillips (2016). Using product descriptions from Form 10-K, Hoberg and Phillips (2016) identify a unique set of rivals for each firm in each year based on pairwise product similarity scores, referred to as the Text-Based Network Industry Classifications (TNIC). The product market concentration ratio is calculated at the TNIC-3 level (i.e., akin to the three-digit Standard Industrial Classification (SIC)). |
| *IB* | Income before extraordinary items. |
| *ICAPT* | Book value of total invested capital. If ICAPT is missing in Compustat, it is calculated as the sum of long-term debt (DLTT), preferred stock (PSTK), noncontrolling interest (MIB), and common equity (CEQ). ICAPT, DLTT, PSTK, MIB, and CEQ are Compustat variables. |
| *LCT* | Current liabilities. |
| *MainSG&A* | SG&A expense excluding R&D, calculated as selling, general, and administrative expense (XSGA) – research and development expense (XRD) – in-process R&D expense (RDIP). |
| *MIB* | Noncontrolling interest (balance sheet). |
| *MII* | Noncontrolling interest (income account). |

| *PSTK* | Preferred / preference stock (capital). |
| *RDIP* | In-process R&D expense, also called IPR&D. |
| *SCIVALUE* | Average scientific value of patents. Scientific value is measured by the number of forward citations based on Kogan et al. (2017). |
| *SIV* | Sale of investments. |
| *SPI* | Special items. |
| *SPPE* | Sale of property. |
| *TOBIN’S Q* | Tobin’s q is defined as market value of the firm over invested capital (ICAPT). Market value of the firm is calculated as market value of equity at fiscal year-end (PRCC_F × CSHO) + book value of assets (AT) – book value of equity, where book value of equity is calculated as shareholders’ equity (SEQ) + deferred taxes (TXDB) + investment tax credit (ITCB) – preferred stock redemption value (PSTKRV). If PSTKRV is missing, preferred stock liquidating value (PSTKL) is used. If both PSTKRV and PSTKL are missing, then carrying value of preferred stock (PSTK) is used. Tobin’s q is calculated for firms with positive shareholders’ equity (SEQ). PRCC_F, CSHO, AT, SEQ, TXDB, ITCB, PSTKRV, PSTKL, PSTK, and ICAPT are Compustat variables. |
| *TSIMM* | Total product similarity score based on Hoberg and Phillips (2016). Using product descriptions from Form 10-K, Hoberg and Phillips (2016) identify a unique set of rivals for each firm in each year based on pairwise product similarity scores, referred to as TNIC. The total product similarity score is calculated at the TNIC-3 level (i.e., akin to the three-digit SIC). |
| *TXDC* | Deferred taxes (cash flow). |
| *TXT* | Income taxes. |
| *WACC* | Weighted average cost of capital, calculated as [R_e × (1 – Debt Ratio)] + [R_d × (1 – ETR) × Debt Ratio]. R_e is cost of equity calculated as the risk-free rate + beta × equity risk premium. R_d is cost of debt calculated as the risk-free rate + the credit spread. R_e and R_d are calculated using data from Federal Reserve Economic Data and Aswath Damodaran’s website. ETR is the effective tax rate. Debt Ratio is calculated as total debt (DLTT + DLC) divided by the sum of total debt and market value of equity (PRCC_F × CSHO). TXT, PI, SPI, DLTT, DLC, PRCC_F, and CSHO are Compustat variables. See Online Appendix A.3 for details. |
| *XINT* | Interest and related expense. |
| *XRD* | Research and development expense. |
| *XSGA* | Selling, general, and administrative expense. |

### TABLE A1
**Estimated Investment Portions and Productive Lives**

| **Digital tech** | | | | | |
| | Mean | 5 | 4 | 72% | 54% |
| | Median | 6 | 4 | 82% | 62% |

Table A1 presents the mean and median values of the parameters estimated for each sector. Under the Revenue-to-Intangibles model, the investment portion of R&D (MainSG&A) ranges from 55 percent to 96 percent (47 percent to 91 percent), and the productive life of R&D (MainSG&A) ranges from five to seven years (three to five years).

The total inflows are almost three times larger than the initial investment and yet the IRR is only 20 percent. This is noteworthy in presenting an alternative performance measure to ARR because ARR does not account for the discount factor for cash flows that occur in different time periods.

We further assume that each year, a company makes a net new investment (new outlay minus sale of old assets) that is 5 percent larger than the last year. Because the payback occurs over nine years, the undepreciated value of invested capital is a running total of the last nine years’ investments and this year’s investment. For example, net new investments of $100, $105, $110, $116, $122, $128, $134, $141, $148, and $155, growing at a 5 percent rate, would lead to an invested capital of $1,258 over ten years from year zero to year nine. The cash recovery in the tenth year based on the Q1 profile would be the sum of nine recoveries, 0 percent of the ninth year investment (that is, of t–1 investment), 0 percent of the eighth year investment (that is, of t–2 investment), 0 percent of the seventh year investment (that is, of t–3 investment), 26 percent of the sixth year investment (that is, of t–4 investment), 53 percent of the fifth year investment (that is, of t–5 investment), 79 percent of the fourth year investment (that is, of t–6 investment), 79 percent of the third year investment (that is, of t–7 investment), 53 percent of the second year investment (that is, of t–8 investment), and 26 percent of the first year investment (that is, of t–9 investment).
