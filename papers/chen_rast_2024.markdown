## Abstract
We examine firm value and performance implications of the growing trend of nontechnology companies engaging in activities relating to digital technologies. We measure digital activities in firms based on the disclosure of digital words in the business description section of 10-Ks. Digital activities are associated with a market-to-book ratio 8%–26% higher than industry peers, and only 25% of the differences in market-to-book is explained by accounting capitalization restrictions. To control for selection bias, we implement lagged dependent variable and IV regressions, and our market-to-book findings are robust to these specifications. Portfolios formed on digital activity disclosure earn a Daniel et al. *The Journal of Finance* 52(3):1035–1058 (1997)-adjusted return of 30% over a three-year horizon and a monthly alpha of 44 basis-points. On the other hand, we find weak evidence of near-term, positive improvements in fundamental performance, as we find some evidence of interim productivity increases but declines in sales growth conditional on digital activities.

## 1 Introduction
The new wave of data-driven digital technologies, such as analytics, artificial intelligence, big data, cloud computing, and machine learning, has brought substantial changes in recent years to how companies are organized, invest, and operate. In 2016 alone, a McKinsey survey estimates, large technology companies invested a total of $20 billion to $30 billion in artificial intelligence (AI) (Bughin et al. 2017).¹ While initial investments in new digital technologies were concentrated in tech firms, recent developments, especially in cloud computing, have also enabled nontechnology firms to invest in these technologies at scale. While, in the past, firms seeking to adopt digital technology had to invest in data infrastructure and hardware, cloud computing provides firms with an alternative option of renting data infrastructure from service providers, such as Amazon Web Services. As a result, digital technologies have become easier to scale up at a lower cost (Brynjolfsson et al. 2019). Recent anecdotal evidence suggests that some nontechnology (nontech) firms have responded by deploying digital technologies at a large scale (Bass 2018). For example, many car manufacturers have invested in self-driving and autonomous technologies, and retailers are investing in digital marketing and data analytics.

Our aim is to identify, characterize and examine the economic performance of firms from nontech industries that are among the first movers in engaging in digital activities relating to analytics, automation, AI, big data, cloud computing, and machine learning. To measure the deployment of these technologies, we construct a dictionary of digital terms and obtain word counts of digital terms in firms’ 10-K reports to proxy for the extent of digital activity.²

We provide novel large-sample empirical findings, consistent with anecdotal evidence, of an increasing trend in the engagement of digital activities by nontech firms in recent years. Our sample consists of all US-listed nontech firms, which are identified by their industry classification, for the fiscal years 2010–2020.³ Based on digital word counts from the business description of 10-Ks, we find that firms are indeed disclosing more about digital activities as the proportion of disclosers of digital terms in our sample increased from 8% in 2010 to 30% in 2020.

Using other measures that track digital activities in firms, we perform validation tests of our text-based proxy. We find that our proxy is associated with a higher probability of filing digital-related patents and a higher proportion of IT workers by 1%–3%, relative to industry peers.⁴ We also find that our proxy is associated with greater (lower) economic similarity with tech (nontech) firms. Specifically, firms with digital activities exhibit higher return co-movement with the tech portfolio by 45%–135% higher comovement with this portfolio (i.e., a firm in the top tercile of digital disclosure exhibits 0.054 higher co-movement, relative to the sample average of 0.04, or 135%) and less co-movement with the nontech portfolio by 5–15%.⁵ Thus these analyses suggest that our proxy identifies nontech firms that are actively engaging in digital activities.

Next we examine the profile of firms that engage in digital activities. Our results suggest that these firms are larger, younger, exhibit higher return volatility, and devote more resources to selling, general, and administrative expenses (SG&A). Past digital activities also significantly predict current digital activity, which suggests going digital is a persistent process. We also find that firms in industries with higher digital activity tend to be more likely to engage in digital activities, consistent with industry-wide complementarities in digital technologies.

Building on the technology adoption literature, we examine whether digital activities increase firm value. Studies, such as the work of Brynjolfsson et al. (2019) and Cockburn et al. (2019), have argued that digital technologies increase the growth opportunities and productivity of firms. Consequently, markets should place a higher valuation on nontech firms that engage in digital activities, due to potential future gains in performance. On the other hand, prior work has also suggested that there are frictions associated with new technologies that may delay or limit their benefits (Bresnahan and Greenstein 1996; Brynjolfsson et al. 2019). Consistent with digital technologies providing net benefits to firms, we find that the market-to-book ratio of nontech firms that engage in digital activities is higher than their industry peers in an economically significant way. Notably, we estimate that a firm that adopts digital activities has an 8%–26% higher market-to-book than its peers. (That is, a firm in the top tercile of digital disclosure exhibits a market-to-book ratio that is 0.792, higher relative to the sample average of 3.09, or 26%.)

We recognize that accounting rules for capitalization could explain some of the market-to-book results as expenditures relating to digital activities are likely not capitalized, thus affecting the book value of equity. We study how capitalization restrictions influence the market-to-book increases that we find in firms with digital activities in two ways. First, we address the capitalization restrictions by controlling directly for the expenditures relating to the intangibles (SG&A and research and development (R&D)). With these controls, we find that differences in market-to-book remain statistically significant but fall in magnitude to about 5%–13%. Second, we control for capitalization restrictions more formally, by correcting the market-to-book ratio for accounting conservatism, following McNichols et al. (2014). We implement the market-to-book adjustment for a subsample of firms with sufficient investment histories, and we show that correcting for accounting conservatism reduces the effect of digital activities on market-to-book by roughly 25%. Specifically, without the conservatism correction, firms that engage in digital activities exhibit a 13%–40% higher market-to-book ratio with the conservatism correction, the same firms exhibit a 10%–30% higher conservatism-corrected market-to-book.

To further address concerns of selection bias, we implement an instrumental variable analysis to examine the robustness of the market-to-book result. We instrument for our digital textual score with a measure of AI technology exposure at the industry-level, which is estimated by the cosine similarity between the abstracts/titles of AI-related patents (which are identified using the methodology of Webb 2020) and NAICS industry descriptions (following the GloVe vector approach of Kogan et al. 2022).⁶ With this instrument, we find that the coefficient on the digital score remains positively significant for the unadjusted and adjusted market-to-book specifications.

We corroborate our market-to-book results with an analysis of the earnings and sales response coefficient (ERC and SRC), conditional on digital activity.⁷ If firms that engage in digital activities are more highly valued by investors, we expect that their ERCs and SRCs would increase, as investors would increase their pricing multiples on earnings and sales. Consistent with this prediction, we find that ERCs for firms with digital activities are substantially higher than those of their peers. Specifically, such a firm exhibits a 24%–73% higher annual ERC HON code 22%–66% higher decile-based ERC than its industry peers. Similarly, we find that SRCs for firms with digital activities are also substantially higher, compared to peers. In particular, a firm with digital activities exhibits 67%–201% higher annual SRC and a 67%–201% higher decile-based SRC, compared to its industry peers. The SRC results are especially noteworthy, as inferences based on the sales-based valuation metric are not confounded with earnings impact of expenses on digital activities that cannot be capitalized per accounting rules.

Next we study the effects of digital activities on future returns. Prior work suggests that innovation is uncertain and difficult to value (Fitzgerald et al. 2021; Lee et al. 2019), thus digital activities for nontech firms could predict returns. We conduct several return predictability tests to investigate this conjecture, and we find that digital activity predicts returns. For long-short value-weighted portfolios formed on digital activity disclosure, we find that these portfolios earn, on average, a 30% Daniel et al. (1997)-adjusted return over three years.⁸,⁹ Moreover, in panel regressions, we find that these portfolios earn $15, 2.8%, 5.7%, and 7.9% returns at the monthly and one-three-year horizons, after controlling for size, book-to-market, operating profit, investment, momentum, SG&A, R&D, and year fixed effects.¹⁰ Finally, in calendar portfolio tests, we find that, after controlling for market, size, value, investment, profitability and momentum risk factors, the digital-based portfolios earn a monthly alpha of 44 basis points.¹¹ These results suggest that digital activities are associated with predictable long-run returns and, from a managerial standpoint, suggest that firms could receive even higher valuations by providing greater disclosure about digital activities.

We also examine whether the long-run drift in returns is explained by the reduction of uncertainty related to digital activities through subsequent digital disclosure over time. Our findings suggest that the long-run returns can be explained by the continuing disclosure of digital activities. Firms that do not continually disclose high-levels of digital terms during the two- and three-year return window, exhibit no statistically significant abnormal returns. While firms that continually disclose high levels of digital activities exhibit significantly positive returns over the two- and three-year horizons. Taken together, our results suggest that continuing disclosure of digital activities is associated with better pricing of digital activities.

We study the SRC, as the valuation of sales, unlike book equity and earnings, is not confounded by capitalization restrictions. Thus examining the effects of digital activities on the SRC is a relatively clean way of studying whether digital activities do indeed increase firm valuations.

Abnormal returns are estimated by deducting the firm’s raw returns from the corresponding firm’s size, book-to-market and momentum quintile portfolio returns, following Daniel et al. (1997).

These portfolios hold firms that are in the top tertile of digital disclosers in the long position and firms that do not disclose digital terms in the short position.

Results are also similar without risk factor controls.

The long-short portfolios also yield a significant unadjusted return of 47 basis points.

Finally, we examine whether the increase in valuations is validated by increases in future financial performance, as measured by return-on-assets, asset turnover, return-on-net operating assets, net operating asset turnover (Soliman 2008), profit margins, and sales growth. We find some evidence of productivity gains from data-driven technologies (Tambe 2014), as we find that firms with digital activities exhibit ROA and asset turnover that is 13%–40% and 2.7%–7.5%, respectively, higher relative to industry peers. We find limited evidence consistent with digital technologies improving long-term productivity in firms. We find that, for firms initiating digital activities, ROA and net operating asset turnover increase by 33%–100% and 7%–23%, respectively, compared to industry peers three years after initial digital disclosure.

On the other hand, we find no significant differences in profit margins and 13%–40% lower sales growth for firms that engage in digital activity, compared to peers. Thus, given these weak accounting performance results, we reconcile these findings with our earlier valuation analysis with the following three interpretations. (1) Digital investments have long payoffs. (2) The benefits of going digital are quickly eroded through market competition, as firms tend to go digital when faced with greater market pressures.¹² (3) Digital technologies could have limited performance effects, but investors are eager to be associated with companies that are disclosing that they are engaging with these technologies (Cooper et al. 2001).

One limitation of the paper is that our findings are associative, and thus we cannot attribute causality to our results. We acknowledge five potential issues, specifically, (1) better performing firms engaging in digital activities, (2) firms selectively disclosing only successful digital activities, (3) firms withholding proprietary information on digital activities, (4) misclassified nontech digital firms, and (5) extrapolating our results for future adopters of digital technologies. We address the first concern by showing that our results are robust to a lagged dependent variable specification and an IV analysis. We argue that the second effect is unlikely, as investment in new technologies leads to uncertain outcomes and success is difficult to predict ex ante. The third concern also seems unlikely, as we find that firms that do not disclose digital activities are associated with negative long-run returns. We evaluate the fourth concern by examining our results after dropping potentially misclassified nontech firms, and we find no changes to our main inferences. We address the fifth concern by cautioning readers from over-generalizing our results to future adopters of digital technologies, as our inferences are based on the sample of early adopters.

Our findings relate to two strands of research. First, we are among the first researchers, to our knowledge, to provide large-sample empirical evidence at the firm level of the impact of AI and other digital technologies. A notable feature of our study is that our proxy for digital activity is created using publicly available data for a wide range of publicly listed firms and is easily replicable. Second, we contribute to the literature on valuation by introducing a new source of nonfinancial information that significantly drives prices. In particular, we find that markets slowly incorporate the value implications of digital technologies over time, as portfolios formed on the disclosure of digital activities earn statistically significant positive returns.

⁴ We use the digital-related patent search terms provided in Bloom et al. (2018) and Webb (2020).  
⁵ In the rest of the text, we use the same methodology to compute the economic ranges.  
⁶ As a measure of technology exposure, this instrument proxies for industries that are more likely to benefit from AI technologies and thus firms within these industries should exhibit a greater likelihood of adopting digital technologies. Consistent with this conjecture, our first-stage regressions show that the measure of AI technology overlap correlates strongly with higher values of the digital score. Moreover, we argue that the assignment of industries that are more exposed to AI technology is fairly exogenous, as many of the patents are filed in universities and other nonprofit organizations.  
⁷ We study the SRC, as the valuation of sales, unlike book equity and earnings, is not confounded by capitalization restrictions. Thus examining the effects of digital activities on the SRC is a relatively clean way of studying whether digital activities do indeed increase firm valuations.  
⁸ Abnormal returns are estimated by deducting the firm’s raw returns from the corresponding firm’s size, book-to-market and momentum quintile portfolio returns, following Daniel et al. (1997).  
⁹ These portfolios hold firms that are in the top tertile of digital disclosers in the long position and firms that do not disclose digital terms in the short position.  
¹⁰ Results are also similar without risk factor controls.  
¹¹ The long-short portfolios also yield a significant unadjusted return of 47 basis points.  
¹² In support of this conjecture, we also find that gross margins (defined as revenues minus cost of goods sold, scaled by sales) is lower in firms with digital activity, compared to peers (see Table A.4 in the internet appendix), which suggests competitive price pressures that are eroding margins.

## 2 Literature review
### 2.1 Digital technology adoption and firm value
The adoption of digital technology potentially enhances firm value in two ways. First, digital technologies can increase firm value by increasing productivity. For example, during the information technology (IT) revolution in the 1990s, several large and diversified organizations benefited from IT adoption by improving inventory management (Brynjolfsson and Hitt 2000). IT adoption also allows firms to produce more (Brynjolfsson and Hitt 1996) and expand more effectively (Hitt 1999). Moreover, recent studies that explore the potential consequences of adopting digital technologies, such as data analytics and AI, suggest that these technologies will also improve firm productivity (Tambe 2014) and facilitate growth (Babina et al. 2022). For example, studies on FinTech have also found that its adoption leads to significant improvements in productivity for financial services firms (Philippon 2016) and that it is highly valued by markets (Chen et al. 2019).

Second, another value-enhancing aspect of digital technologies is that they potentially increase the value of existing investments within the firm. Recent studies that explore the potential productivity benefits of AI have argued that these technologies are general purpose technologies (GPT), which complement existing investments (Cockburn et al. 2019) and thus increase the value of existing resources.

#### 2.1.1 Frictions in adopting new technology
Although technology adoption potentially introduces many benefits to the firm, these take a long time to be realized, lowering their value, especially in the short term. In the late 1980s, the benefits of IT adoption took so long to manifest that they were not evident in the data, leading Robert Solow to coin *Solow’s paradox* – the observation that you can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.

There are several reasons that explain why the benefits of IT adoption manifest slowly. First, adopting technologies requires developing complementary organizational capabilities (Bresnahan and Greenstein 1996), which may be difficult without sufficient managerial expertise. Bloom et al. (2012) illustrate this point, as they show that managerial capabilities explain the US-Europe productivity gap in IT adoption. Specifically, the authors find that US firms have better “people-management” practices that allow US firms to more effectively implement the necessary organizational changes that complement IT adoption.¹³ Notably, these findings also generalize to the adoption of digital technologies. Organizational changes are also required to generate value from these technologies, as the technologies require employees with data expertise and the creation of new organizational structures that emphasize knowledge sharing (Cockburn et al. 2019). These changes are difficult to implement quickly and could explain why we do not observe immediate changes in firm performance from digital technology adoption (Brynjolfsson et al. 2019).

Second, new technology adoption incurs high fixed costs of implementation and of creating new markets. Consistent with this view, several empirical studies show that the benefits of technology adoption are higher for firms in places or industries that have already adopted the technology (Dranove et al. 2014), as shared fixed costs – in the form of developing human capital and physical infrastructure – are lower for later entrants. Moreover, the cost of creating new markets is also a shared fixed cost borne by early entrants. For example, Brynjolfsson and Smith (2000) found that early internet retailers had to provide lower prices and spend more on advertising to convince consumers to trust internet retailing. Similarly, new products and services that are based on digital technologies may be unfamiliar to consumers, and additional investments must be made by early adopters to create markets for these products and services.

In sum, the literature outlines various frictions, which may delay or limit the benefits of adopting new technology. Hence whether the new digital technologies provide net value to firms when adopted is an open empirical question.

¹³ For example, better reward-punishment practices, performance evaluations.

#### 2.1.2 Challenges in empirical research on technology adoption
A key empirical challenge in many studies on technology adoption is the difficulty in identifying investments in new technologies. Measures of R&D or capital expenditures do not suffice, as these capture the firms’ total investment and not just in the new technologies. Therefore scholars have had to rely on alternative methods of identifying new technology investment. For example, several studies on IT adoption have relied on survey data: one source was Computer Intelligence Infocorp, which tracked the stock of computer hardware across Fortune 1000 firms (Hitt 1999). Another source is the Census Bureau; however, census survey data are limited to only the industry level.

Firm-level data on digital and AI-related technologies are even more sparse. This has led to calls for new measures of digital technology adoption (Seamans and Raj 2019). Recent studies have developed measures of AI adoption through the technology skillsets of workers (Babina et al. 2022; Rock 2019; Tambe et al. 2019; Abis and Veldkamp 2020). However, these labor-based measures cover only a subset of public firms and are not widely available to researchers. In contrast, we develop a new measure of digital technology based on the firm’s disclosure of its digital activities, which is easily replicable for a large sample of publicly listed firms.

### 2.2 Valuation and nonfinancial information
#### 2.2.1 The growing wedge between book and market equity values
Following the rapid growth of the technology industry in the 1990s, several studies examined the failure of accounting systems in measuring the technology investment by firms. Specifically, scholars expressed concern that the rules on accounting for R&D expenditures reduced the value-relevance of accounting numbers because, under FAS No. 2, R&D must be immediately expensed. Thus, the accounting for R&D does not capture the underlying economics of the investment. To illustrate that accounting rules obscured a key source of information from markets, Lev and Sougiannis (1996) showed that R&D capitalization is value-relevant to capital markets.

A key point of Lev and Sougiannis (1996) is that the standard accounting of firm performance is unsuited to firms that engage in high levels of R&D. This fact is especially concerning in today’s economy, with increasing investment in intangibles through R&D and Ohio other forms of expenditures. Indeed, research (Lev and Zarowin 1999; Core et al. 2003) find that the value-relevance of accounting measures have decreased over time as a result of the greater importance of intangible investments. This trend suggests that there is a growing wedge between accounting and economic value, which highlights a need for more research into value-relevant nonfinancial information.

#### 2.2.2 Value-relevance of nonfinancial information
One of the first studies to investigate the value-relevance properties of nonfinancial information was by Amir and Lev (1996). The authors found that, for cell phone firms, nonfinancial metrics, such as the population of the service area, were value-relevant to investors. Similarly, they also studies showed that Trueman et al. and Trueman et al. (2000, 2001) showed that internet usage metrics provided value-relevant information about tech companies to investors, beyond accounting numbers.

Furthermore, studies have conducted textual analysis of corporate disclosures to examine relationships between nonfinancial variables and prices, much like we do here (Li 2008, 2010; Li et al. 2013; You and Zhang 2009; Feldman et al. 2010; Campbell et al. 2014; Hope et al. 2016). For example, Li (2010) shows that some linguistic features of the qualitative disclosures in the MD&A section indicates that are associated with the future financial performance.

The findings of our study build on this literature that uses textual disclosures or nonfinancial metrics to uncover information that is useful for valuation and predicting performance. In particular, we find that our textual-based proxy for digital activities can help predict future improvements in ROA as well as return performance over a three-year horizon.

### 2.3 Innovation and return predictability
#### Literature review
Our study also relates to several studies that have explored the return predictability of students in firms. A key insight from this literature is that innovation is hard to value for investors and the valuation uncertainty can lead to higher returns. For instance, studies have shown that innovation links (Lee et al. 2019), innovative efficiency (Hirshleifer et al. 2013), and the originality of innovation (Li et al.). are liable to investors and thus predict returns.

On the other hand, some accounting studies have questioned whether innovation, as measured by R&D, continues to drive a higher future profitability and returns for firms. For instance, Resutek (2021) argues that because R&D behaves more like a fixed cost, and thus future returns and profitability of R&D expenditure is due to the operating leverage effect of R&D. Moreover, we Curtis et al. (2020) show that the profitability of R&D is driven by shifts towards investment in safer innovations. Thus there is also reason to expect that the payoffs from innovation, as measured by R&D, are becoming more certain and should thus be associated with less return predictability.

We contribute to these studies by examining the return predictability of digital activity. The setting of digital activities merits further study for two reasons.

First, the value of digital technologies has increased substantially over the past few decades, due to structural changes in the US economy. Digital technologies have become more valuable partly because macroeconomic trends (such as globalization) have shifted the US economy away from manual routine labor and have pushed companies to automate some of their operations (Autor et al. 2015). Furthermore, a patent protections for software have also increased substantively over the past few decades and have thus increased the value of software-based intellectual property (Jaffe and Lerner 2004). Hence there is some reason to believe that there is an increasing value in the adoption of digital technologies, relative to other forms of investment.

Second, in contrast to studies in the innovation literature, we study innovation through the deployment of existing digital technologies in nontechnology firms. Thus the principal bottleneck in the digital innovation process is arguably the organizational co-invention costs (Bresnahan and Greenstein 1996), rather than the technology itself (Lakhani and Iansiti 2020). In particular, the uncertainty arising from these costs is primarily strategic and thus quite different from the technological uncertainty observed in typical R&D and patenting. The uncertainty concerning co-invention costs is also difficult to measure with tangible metrics, which thus portends high uncertainty for investors and greater return predictability.

## 3 Data
We construct our sample from several sources. We begin with all US incorporated or headquartered firms from the intersection of Compustat and CRSP from fiscal years 2010 to 2020 with share codes 10, 11, and 12 in CRSP. We also include earnings/sales forecasts from IBES and 10-K filings from the SEC EDGAR database.

Our analysis focuses on the digital activities of nontech firms, so we construct a sample of nontech firms from our initial sample. We first define tech firms as firms that operate in industries relating to computers, electronics, communications, data processing, and internet services. Subsequently, we develop a parsimonious industry-based classification for universities by searching through the SIC, NAICS, and GICS industries definitions (presented in Appendix Table 12), and we remove all firms that are classified as tech firms from our analysis.¹⁴

The main subject of our study is that digital activities are , and we proxy for these activities by identifying digital terms in the firms’ disclosures. Specifically, we construct a dictionary of digital terms, revolving around seven topics—analytics, automation, artificial intelligence (AI), cloud (–computing), digitization, and machine learning—to count digital terms in the firms’ disclosures.¹⁵ These terms were identified from numerous articles on the digital phenomena as well as glossaries of digital terms provided by consulting firms that specialize in digital transformation.

We analyze the 10-K report to count mentions of digital terms. We focus on the business description section of the 10-K, and we identify the beginning and end of this section by searching for the line with either “Item1” or “Business” and the lines with either “Item1A” or “Risk Factors.”

To address concerns that the raw count of words is a noisy measure of digital activity, we quantize the raw counts into terciles that are coded as follows: 0 if no digital activity is disclosed, 1,2,3 if digital mentions fall in the bottom, middle, and top tertile of digital mentions in the year, respectively. In the subsequent tests, our find that we use this score as our main proxy for this variable.

#### 3.1 Sample statistics
We report the sample statistics for the main variables in our study found in that that Table 1 and describe several key characteristics of the sample of our nontech firms below in our sample.¹ First, the market-to-book ratio of nontech firms in our sample tends to be lower at a mean (median) market-to-book of approximately 3.1 (1.8), compared to 4.4 (2.6) for tech firms.¹⁷ Additionally, we sample the firms are older, finding a sample with a mean (median) age of 25 (21) years, compared to 20 (18) years for tech firms.¹⁶

Second, we also find that the nontech firms do not significantly co-move with a significant tech market with the technology portfolio, as the a average beta on this is 0.04 is . By contrast, on the nontech firms we find that co-move strongly with a significant amount with nontech firms a nontech firm with an average beta on this of 1.333 is . Taken together by , these findings suggest that there are significant characteristic significant differences between nontech and tech and firms.

¹⁴ For NAICS industries, we use the code 517 for industries NAICS and convert to 2019 for industries defined in past versions via NAICS crosswalks. We also drop firms that do not have a four-digit NAICS code. For GICS industries, we define by the technology industries based on current (2018 version) and historical GICS codes GICS codes .  
¹⁵ For example, we outline the specific keywords within these topics for keywords in Appendix Table 11.  
¹⁶ We report the sample statistics of the tech firms in Table A for A.1 in the internet appendix for Table A.  
¹⁷ Table A provides the statistics for tech firms in the internet appendix A.

### 4 Nontech firms and digital activity
Our first key finding is that our sample of nontech firms are increasingly discovering digital activities in the . We illustrate this by aggregating the number of digital terms in the 10-K and plot the distribution over time for time in. Figure 1 shows that the disclosure of digital activity is steadily increasing over time.¹⁸ This trend suggests that speaks to the increasing relevance of our study on the phenomenon and motivates our study on .

Next we find that our sample breaks down by analyzing the aggregate digital terms by topic group in Table A of Figure 1 and by Panel A for Table A.2 and find that we see the increasing trend exists for across all topics in . A Notably , . digital terms are most concentrated around in “analytics” , which has 112 mentions of A in 10-Ks at 355 firms across 355 firms in 2020. A The disclosure of “digitization” also is also quite frequent, with 415 mentions in A across 232 firms in A for 2020 in 2021 . By A We also report the analysis of digital word counts by industry in Table B by Panel B for Panel A of Table A and find that we find it is highest for in the industry manufacturing, financial services, , and finance industry but for A is growing across all other industries in A.

#### 2.1 Validation of the digital activities proxy
To validate our text-based sample , we examine whether our measure of digital activity is a proxy for proxy is associated with other measures that track the extent of digital activities in for the sample . We implement this by regressing a regression of alternative measures of digital activities on our proxy for proxy . . Specifically , for regression , we implement the following regression model for A :

   **Equation 1:**
   ```
   Var_{i,t} = \alpha_j + \alpha_t + \zeta_1 \text{Digital}_{i,t} + \sum_j \gamma_s X_{s,jt} + \epsilon_{i,t},
   ```

   where A we regress regression of the dependent variable on our dependent variable on proxy and variable on dependent on variable . A dependent variable is regressed on the digital activity proxy for proxy , with a control set of variables including (∑_s X_s,j), namely , A , size (of log A market cap), firm’s age, for leverage ratio, market-to-book ratio, , ROA for ROA , to sales growth , for A , sales , annual revenue growth , market return A , annual return , adjusted for market , and for number of words in A the business description section of A . We also control A for fixed effects by year and by industry and year (Fama-French 48 for industry) fixed effects and cluster standard errors by year at industry level and at firm level .

The first variable that we examine for regression is the dependent variable probability of filing a dependent variable digital activity related to patents for A . A These are identified by patent search terms related to A for AI , , cloud computing , cloud , computing , machine learning , cloud computing , neural networks , machine learning , robots , neural network , self-driving cars , robots , and software for A , self-driving , software development (taken from Bloom , et al. for A (2018) and Webb , A (2020) for A ).A The first A column A of Table A for Table 3 by Panel A in Panel A examines Table 3 A the relationship A between A and our proxy for digital activities proxy and A , and A we find shows that firms A with digital activities exhibit A a 1% to A to 3% A higher probability for A of filing A such as patents A (or A 20%–60% higher probability , for A relative to A , sample average A of at 5% A ).A

[^19]: We link the patent data to our dataset with the CRSP-patent link table provided by Kogan et al. (2017), which covers patent data from calendar years 1925–2019 (September). Thus we exercise the patent data for a subsample of firm-year observations from fiscal years 2010–2018: 16315 A.

### 5 Financial performance analysis
We first examine the various accounting metrics of productivity in Table 9. In Panels A and B, we study ROA and asset turnover. The analysis in the first column shows that firms with digital activities yield an additional **0.4%–1.2%** of ROA and **2%–6%** of asset turnover compared to peers (or **13%–40%** and **2.5%–7.5%**, relative to the sample average of **3%** and **78%**).⁵⁰ In columns 2–5, we study the current and one-to-three-year changes in ROA after initial digital disclosure and show that ROA increases by **1%–3%** over the three years after initial disclosure (or 33%–100%** on a relative basis). However, we do not find any significant changes in the year of or one and two years after initial disclosure.

Next we examine the return on net operating assets and net operating asset turnover (Soliman 2008; Nissim and Penman 2001) in Panels C and D. We find that the return on net operating assets is **1.6%–4.8%** higher in firms with digital activities compared to peers (or **40%–120%**, relative to the sample average of **4%**). While net operating asset turnover in firms with digital activities is not statistically different compared to peers, we find that net operating asset turnover increases by **17%–51%** (or **7%–23%**, relative to the sample average of 2.18) over the three years after initial digital disclosure. Thus, consistent with prior work (Tambe 2014), we find limited evidence that digital activity improves long-run productivity.

In Table 10, we continue our investigation into the accounting performance consequences of digital activities by examining accounting metrics of market competition, namely, profit margins and sales growth. For profit margins, reported in Panel A, we find no significant differences between firms with digital activity and peers, and we find no significant changes in margins for firms initiating digital activity. Surprisingly, we find that firms with digital activities are associated with declines in sales growth. In Panel B, we find that firms with digital activities exhibit **0.8%–2.4%** lower sales growth relative to industry peers (**or 13–40%** relative to the sample average of **6%**). However, the declines in sales growth do not persist, as we find that firms initiating digital activity do not exhibit statistically significant changes in sales growth.

#### 5.4 Discussion
##### 5.4.1 Reconciling the valuation and fundamental performance results
Previously, we reported weak evidence that digital activity improves fundamental performance. Although our findings suggest that productivity improves for firms with digital activity, we find no significant changes in profit margins and decreases in sales growth for these firms. These results are puzzling, given our earlier findings of a positive association between digital activity and valuations. We offer several explanations to help reconcile this apparent puzzle.

First, the increases in valuation could be driven by increases in the market expectation of growth opportunities that are not reflected in immediate changes in performance. Although these growth opportunities should eventually be realized in performance improvements, it is unclear when that would occur. Notably, prior evidence on the payoffs to IT investment shows that the payoffs to these take **up to seven years** to fully realize (**Brynjolfsson and Hitt 2003**). Thus our limited results on the changes in future financial ratios possibly reflect the fact that **investment in digital technologies** also take a long time to bear fruit.

Second, some of the gains from digital activities could be **eroded by market competition**. For profit margins and sales growth, there may be **little improvement** in these performance measures if competitors are also making similar investments in digital technologies.⁵¹ Moreover, under the market competition story, one should still observe **gains in productivity-based metrics** because productivity is less likely to be affected by market pressures on price. Indeed we find some consistent associations between digital activity and productivity measures, like prior work (**Tambe 2014**). Under this interpretation, the pricing effects of digital activities would therefore be driven by the **potential future productivity gains** rather than the **margin gains** of digital technologies.

Third, the performance benefits of digital technologies **could well be limited**, but the pricing effects reflect a **demand from investors** for firms that engage with these technologies. This view is motivated by anecdotes from the **dot-com era**, when firms that were marginally linked to the internet received **higher valuations**, despite **limited performance gains**. For instance, **Cooper et al. (2001)** document that merely including **“dot-com”** in a company’s name was sufficient to drive large and persistent valuation changes, without **commensurate changes in the fundamentals**. Given the **weak accounting performance** results that we document, we acknowledge that such a phenomenon could reconcile our accounting performance and valuation results.

⁵¹ In support of this conjecture, we also find that **gross margins** (defined as revenues minus cost of goods sold, scaled by sales) is **lower** in firms with digital activity, compared to peers (see **Table A.4** in the internet appendix), which suggests **competitive price pressures** that are eroding margins.

##### 5.4.2 Potential selection bias
A concern in interpreting our results is that they may be driven by **selection bias**. One such bias is that our results may be driven by **better performing firms** that also adopt digital technologies. The **valuation effects** of digital activities would thus be an artifact of the **higher valuations** of better performers. We argue that this form of selection bias is **unlikely**, as our determinant results (**Table 4**) show that **lagged sales growth** and **returns** relate negatively to initial digital disclosure. We also address this form of selection bias in **Table 5** by showing robustness of our main results in the **lagged market-to-book specification**, which compares firms with digital activities with **similar market-to-book peers**. Finally, we address this concern by implementing an **IV analysis**, and we find that our results are also robust to this specification.

Another concern related to selection bias is that our results may be driven by **selective disclosure**. We argue that this is **unlikely** to be a contributing factor to our results because we document **weak evidence** on the **accounting performance benefits** for digital activities and a **long-run market response** to the value implications of these activities. Both of these results suggest that the **success of digital activities** is **difficult to assess ex ante** and thus cast doubt on whether firms can **selectively disclose** only successful digital activities. We also argue that the **proprietary cost channel** for selective disclosure is an **unlikely explanation** for our findings. Specifically, for the proprietary cost argument to hold, firms that **withhold information** should generate **long-run value** as they possess proprietary technologies. In contrast, our results show that firms that **do not disclose digital activities** earn **significant long-run negative returns**.

Finally, another concern is that the **nontech firms** with digital activities in our study could be **misclassified** tech firms. We address this concern in two ways. First, we **drop firms** that exhibit a **median** **β₀** that is **in the top 2.5 percentile** of the median **β₀** for all nontech firms. With this sample, we **find that** our main inferences are **unchanged**. Second, we **drop firms** that made **digital disclosures** **in the years before 2010**, which is **the year when** we observe an **upswing** in **nontech firms** starting to **go digital**. We **find that** our main inferences are **unchanged** with this sample.⁵²

⁵² We report these analyses in **Tables A.7 and A.8** in the **internet appendix**.

### 6 Conclusion
In recent years, a **growing number of nontech firms** have made **investments in digital technologies** that have the **potential to transform businesses** and **create greater firm value** (**Brynjolfsson et al. 2019**). We look at this **motivated by** this trend by , our objective is **to characterize** the **firms that adopt** these technologies and **evaluate the valuation** and **performance benefits**.

While **part of these** **level differences** of are **attributable to** thecapitalization restrictions on the **capitalization restrictions** for on **digital activity expenditures** by , we also **still observe** some **economically and statistically significant** **significant level differences** in after controlling **signatures** for the **capitalization restrictions** effect of . We **also find that **also** find that **digital activities** also **increase** the **valuations of earnings** and **sales growth** , which **further corroborates** our claim that **the claim** that **digital activities** do **increase** our valuations. Moreover, **Moreover**, our **portfolios based on** formed by **digital disclosure** based on **significantly significant** predict **significantly** **returns** and **deliver** a **44-basis-point** basis point **alpha** in a **FamaFrench 5-factor** model plus **5-factor** plus **momentum** model by .⁵³ Though we **caution** the reader from **overgeneralizing** our results, **our findings** as , we are **for documenting** **the returns** **for early adoption** of adopters **of digital** technologies by , **which may** not **apply to** the **future adoption** of adopters **of the future** of these **for technologies** by . 

However, we **find that our results** are **weak** when results **when examining** for **examine the** **implication** of **of digital activities** for **on accounting performance** measures of **performance measures** by . **ROA** for **ROA** and **asset turnover** show improve **improve**, suggesting **suggests that **digital** activities that **offer gains** in **firm productivity** for (**productivity** (**Tambe 2014**)), by while **profit margin** margins **profit margins** and **sales growth** for **sales growth** are **either insignificantly** or **significantly** **negatively significant** **associated with** **with digital activities** by .**digital activities**. We **recoreconcile** the **weak** **accounting** **performance gains** of **gains of digital activities** for firms with **with our** **valuation findings** by **as possible as** possibly **due to** as (**due to**) (**(1)**) the **long payoffs** in **for digital investments** by , (**investments**)), (**(2)**) competitive pressures **competition** , **by** and (**by**) (**(3)**) **market euphoria** (**Cooper et al.** , **2001**). **By understanding** which **Understanding** of **these factors** **of these** **explains** our **explains** **results** is an **intriguing question** , **question**, **and** we **leave** a **a detailed study** for **of this for** **future research** for future .

| **Fundamental Variables:** | |
| SIZE | Logarithm of market capitalization at the fiscal year end (prc × shrout in CRSP) |
| LEV | Leverage ratio, defined as total debt divided by stockholder’s equity (dltt in Compustat) |
| LOSS | Coded as 1 where operating income after depreciation (oiadp in Compustat) is negative and 0 otherwise. |
| PERS | The AR(1) coefficient in quarterly EPS (defined as earnings per share before extraordinary items, epspxq in Compustat) regressed on EPS reported in the same quarter in the previous year, estimated over rolling four-year windows. |
| MB | Market-to-book ratio, defined as the ratio of the market capitalization at the end of the day after the 10-K filing date divided by total common equity (ceq in Compustat). |
| CCMB | The conservatism-corrected market-to-book ratio is defined as market-to-book (defined above) adjusted for net financing assets, divided by the conservatism correction factor (following McNichols et al. 2014). See the internet appendix for more details on the computation of this factor. |
| AGE | Logarithm of firm age. Age is determined by the number of years since the firm first appeared in Compustat. |
| ROA | Defined as operating income after depreciation scaled by average in Compustat. |
| RNOA | Defined following Soliman (2008) as operating income after depreciation scaled by average net operating assets from beginning to end of the fiscal period (oiadp/(noa_t + noa_t-1)/2 in Compustat). Net operating assets is defined as the difference in operating assets (at-che-ivao in Compustat) and operating liabilities (at-dlc-dltt-txp-wib in Compustat). As net operating assets are not well defined for finance firms (SIC code 6000-6799), we drop these firms from the estimation. |
| MARGINS | Profit margins defined as operating income after depreciation scaled by sales (oiadp/sale in Compustat). |
| ATO | Sales scaled by average total assets from beginning to end of the fiscal period. (sale/((at_t + at_t-1)/2 in Compustat). |
| NOATO | Sales scaled by average net operating assets from beginning to end of the fiscal period. As net operating assets are not well-defined for finance firms (SIC code 6000-6799), we drop these firms from the estimation. |
| SALES GROWTH | Sales growth, annualized difference in future period t+s sales minus current sales in period t scaled by the current period sales. ((sale_ts - sale_t)/sale_ts) in Compustat). |
| CapEx | Capital expenditure intensity, defined as capital expenditures scaled by assets (capx/at in Compustat). |

| SG&A | Selling, general and administrative expenditure intensity, defined as SG&A expense minus R&D minus R&D in place scaled by assets (xsga-xrd-in in Compustat). Following Peters and Taylor (2017), we keep the original xsga as SG&A expense if xrd xsga but xrd cogs. If missing this variable is coded as 0. |
| R&D | Research and development expenditure intensity, defined as R&D scaled by assets (xrd/at in Compustat). If missing, this variable is coded as 0. |
| Investment | Defined as the difference in current period assets (at in Compustat) and lagged assets scaled by lagged assets. |
| BM | Book-to-market ratio, defined as the ratio of total common equity (ceq in Compustat) divided by the market capitalization at the end of the fiscal period. |
| Operating Profit | Defined as sales (sale in Compustat) minus cost of goods sold (cogs in Compustat) minus interest expense (xint in Compustat) minus sales, general and administrative expense (xsga in Compustat), divided by book equity defined above. |
| **Returns and Liquidity Variables:** | |
| | The beta coefficient estimated from a regression of daily returns on CRSP value-weighed market returns over the fiscal year. |
| β_Tech or β_NTech | The tech or nontech beta coefficient on the technology portfolio estimated from a regression of the following factor model: R_{i,t} = α_i + β_{i,Tech} R_{Tech,t} + β_{i,Nt} R_{Nt,t} + ε_t over the fiscal year. R_{Tech,t} is the value-weighed portfolio returns of tech firms that are defined in Appendix Table 12, and the portfolio is re-balanced daily. R_{NT,t} is the value-weighted portfolio returns of nontech firms, and the portfolio is re-balanced daily. Daily returns with stock prices of less than $5 are dropped from the estimation, and β_Tech or β_NTech estimated with less than 200 days of returns observations are also dropped. |
| Market-Adj. Returns | The buy-hold raw returns in the fiscal year minus the value-weighed CRSP market return distribution. |
| Share Turnover | Monthly share volume divided by the shares outstanding (vol/shrout in CRSP), averaged over the fiscal year. |
| Return Volatility | Standard deviation of daily returns estimated over the fiscal year. |
| Momentum | Defined as the past twelve month to lagged one month buy-and-hold returns minus the buy-and-hold value-weighted market portfolio return over the same period. |
| **Earnings Announcement Variables:** | |
| Unexpected Earnings or Sales | Unexpected earnings is actual minus median earnings (sales) per share forecasts scaled by the price at the end of the fiscal period from IBES. The median earnings (sales) forecasts are based on the most recent analyst consensus forecast, within 100 days before the earnings announcement. We remove observations where the price at the end of the fiscal period is less than $1 and where the earnings surprise is in excess of price. |
| Days to EA | Number of business days between earnings announcement and fiscal year-end. |
| Days to 10-K Filing | Number of business days between 10-K filing and fiscal year-end. |
| Days Between 10-K Filing & EA | Number of business days between 10-K filing and earnings announcement. |
| CAR(-1,40) | The cumulative adjusted returns from one day before the earnings announcement to forty trading days after. Benchmark returns are estimated using the coefficients from the Carhart, Fama–French Four-Factor model (Carhart 1997) estimated based on a (-280,-60) window. |
| **Digital Activity:** | |
| Digital Score | A quantized digital score coded as 0 for no digital disclosure, 1 for yearly below tercile disclosure, 2 for yearly middle tercile disclosure, and 3 for top tercile disclosure. Counts of digital terms are taken from the business description section of the 10-K, and digital terms are taken from the dictionary of terms in Appendix Table 11. |
| Digital Score (Returns Portfolio) | For the noncontinuing digital score, we re-code the digital score as defined above as 0 for firms that continuously make top tertile disclosures of digital terms in the returns window (either two years or three years). For the continuing digital scores, we re-code the digital score as 0 for all firms that do not continually make top tertile disclosures of digital terms in the returns window. |
| **Other Variables:** | |
| Tech Manager | An indicator that is set to 1 and 0 otherwise, if one of the firm’s top five executives has a technology-related managerial title. We define technology-related titles as either vp digital, chief information officer (cio) or chief technology officer (cto). Data on the top five executives is sourced from Capital IQ’s People Intelligence. |
| Total Words | Natural logarithm of the total number of words in the business description section. Data taken from 10-K filings obtained through SEC EDGAR. |
| Digital Patents | An indicator that is coded as 1 and 0 otherwise, if the firm files a patent relating to digital technologies. We identify such patents by the title and abstract search terms relating to AI, cloud computing, machine learning, neural network, robots, self-driving cars and software as defined by Bloom et al. (2018) and Webb (2020). |
| Proportion of IT workers | The proportion of IT workers relative to total number of employees in the firm. Data is from Revelio Labs. |

## Appendix Table 4: Examples of Digital Disclosure

### Mistras Group Inc., Fiscal Year: 2011
Historically, NDT solutions predominantly used **qualitative testing methods** aimed primarily at detecting defects in the tested materials. This methodology, which we categorize as **traditional NDT**, is typically **labor intensive** and, as a result, considerably **dependent upon the availability and skill level** of the certified technicians, engineers and scientists performing the inspection services. The traditional **NDT market** is highly fragmented, with a **significant number** of small vendors providing inspection services to divisions of companies or local governments situated in close proximity to the vendor’s **field inspection personnel**. Today, we believe that **customers are increasingly looking for** a **single vendor capable** of providing a **wider spectrum** of **asset protection solutions** for their **global infrastructure** that we call **one source**. This **shift in underlying demand**, which began in the early **1990s**, has contributed to a **transition from traditional NDT solutions** to more **advanced solutions** that employ **automated digital sensor technologies** and **accompanying enterprise software**, allowing for the **effective capture**, **storage**, **analysis** and **reporting of inspection and engineering results** results **electronically and in digital formats**. These **advanced techniques**, taken together with **advances in wired and wireless communication** and **information technologies**, have further enabled the development of **remote monitoring systems**, **asset-management** and **predictive maintenance capabilities** and **other data analytics** and **management**. We believe that as **advanced asset protection solutions** continue to **gain acceptance** among **asset-intensive organizations**, only those **vendors offering** **broad**, **complete** and **integrated solutions**, **scalable operations** and a **global footprint** will have a **distinct competitive advantage**. Moreover, we believe that **vendors that are able to effectively deliver** both **advanced solutions** and **data analytics**, by virtue of their **access to customers’ data**, develop a **significant barrier to entry** for competitors, and so develop the **capability to create significant recurring revenues**.
