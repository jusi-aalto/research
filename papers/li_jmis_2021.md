## Abstract
This research examines the joint effects of information technology (IT) strategies and security investments on organizational security breaches. We focus on two forms of IT strategies: digitalization and embeddedness in IT outsourcing networks. Our longitudinal analysis of U.S. hospitals demonstrates that IT security investments reduce security breaches in less digitalized organizations but increase security breaches for highly digitalized organizations. Investing in technical network control security systems such as anti-virus and intrusion detection systems reduces external breaches. Implementing identity and access management security systems such as biometric scanning and user authentication decreases internal breaches but increases external breaches. However, organizations' embeddedness in IT outsourcing networks weakens the impacts of these technologies investments on external breaches but amplifies the negative relationship between identity and access management security systems and internal breaches. Our results offer an alternative understanding of organizational IT security investments and explain contrary results found in prior studies. Practical guidelines on organizational IT security strategies are discussed.

## Introduction
Security incidents have negative consequences for organizations and their stakeholders [13], driving ever-increasing levels of information technology (IT) security-related investments. Decisions on IT security investments require evaluating risk factors and assessing the effectiveness of acquired IT security hardware and software [8, 20]. Prior literature has examined the performance (often measured by security breaches) implications of organizational IT security investments [e.g., 1, 32, 33], but this research has yielded mixed results. For example, studies taking deterrence and resource-based theoretical perspectives treat security protection systems as IT resource guardians, showing that IT security investments reduce security breaches [e.g., 32, 33]. Conversely, some research findings contend that more IT security investments signal that an organization's information assets are of high value, making them attractive to attack [e.g., 1].

Past studies have primarily explored two sets of contingent factors to explain the inconsistencies mentioned above, including (1) organizational non-IT related institutional attributes such as firm size, age, and type [1]; and (2) the strategic execution of IT protection systems such as implementation timing (i.e., before or after security breaches) [32]. However, a minimal amount of research has considered that the effects of IT security investments on security breaches may depend on the organization's IT strategies. This would seemingly be important given that organizations are vigorously pursuing digital transformation strategies, whereby almost all information is moving to storage in a digital format. Hence, consistent with the recommendations from Mithas et al. [37], we examine two forms of IT strategies: digitalization and IT outsourcing, to fill a gap in the literature and add insight toward resolving inconsistencies in the past research.

Digitalization refers to the extent to which IT is embedded in an organization's business processes to improve its business models and value propositions [17]. For example, healthcare providers have adopted digital systems such as clinical decision support systems to enhance healthcare quality and reduce costs [2]. Consequently, information on patients, physicians, and hospitals' surgical and business operations delivered in digital systems becomes more vulnerable. Furthermore, with the digitalization process, organizations can outsource their IT systems to third-party vendors or operate them in-house [21]. If outsourced, the firm engages in intense flows of organizational information between itself and the outsourcing vendors. In essence, the firm that is outsourcing information assets embeds itself in a network position relative to its IT outsourcing vendors [19]. The extent of organizations' network embeddedness poses systems interdependency risks [3,25], fertilizes the diffusion of security vulnerabilities [51], and reduces the cycle of vulnerability disclosure [40].

While IT strategies (i.e., digitalization and IT outsourcing network embeddedness) introduce additional security vulnerabilities, by themselves, they do not necessarily increase organizations' security breaches. This is partly due to the fact that organizations mandatorily and/or deliberatively implement security protection systems such as antivirus software, data encryption, and intrusion detection systems given different levels of security vulnerabilities [1,32]. Instead, IT strategies can draw attention as potential attack targets, inferring different levels of security protection problems, protection strategies, and protection effectiveness. This suggests a causal path whereby IT strategies and security investments jointly influence organizational security breaches. Therefore, this research examines how the effects of security investments on security breaches vary in organizations with different IT strategies (i.e., levels of digitalization and embeddedness in the IT outsourcing network).

We conducted a longitudinal study of the U.S. hospitals during 2005-2013 to answer our research question. Our empirical analysis reveals several insights about the mechanisms of security investments and their link to breaches. First, IT security investments can play either the guardianship or the signaling role in security breaches depending on the organization's digitalization levels. Organizations with low digitalization tend to attract opportunistic hackers with mass attacks, which can be effectively deterred by security protection systems (i.e., guardianship). Beyond these "random" attacks, highly digitalized organizations attract strategic hackers who perform more sophisticated attacks and view security investments as informational cues in selecting targets (i.e., signaling). Consequently, security investments increase security breaches for organizations with higher digitalization.

Furthermore, the guardianship or signaling roles of IT security investments can be separated by distinguishing security protection systems and breach types. Demonstrating the guardianship role of security investments, technical network control (TNC) systems such as anti-virus, encryption, and spyware filters reduce external breaches. While identity and access management (IAM) security systems such as iris scanning, user authentication, and single sign-on decrease internal breaches, they may be interpreted as informational cues by hackers when selecting targets, thereby increasing external breaches. Additionally, organizations' network embeddedness weakens the effects of IAM and TNC on external breaches but amplifies the negative relationship between IAM and internal breaches. Our findings provide theoretical implications for understanding the role of IT security investments and, accordingly, yield practical insights for undertaking better security strategies.

## Theory and Hypothesis

### Routine Activity Theory as an Overarching Framework
The IT security researchers often conceptualize security incidents as crimes and thus employ criminology theories as foundations to understand the phenomenon and behaviors of cyber-criminals [e.g., 22, 50]. Following rational choice theory in criminology [5], this theoretical perspective assumes that attackers make rational decisions [16]. Criminology theories can effectively explain how social psychological factors cause security incidents such as malicious insider threats and external hacks [55]. Earlier studies adopted the deterrence theory to examine the effects of countermeasures and IT security policies on security behaviors and incidents [e.g., 14, 22, 50]. Assuming that offenders make criminal decisions based on calculated gain and consequences, deterrence theory predicts that criminal behaviors can be deterred if the penalties from the post-event security policies are certain, severe, and swift [14, 55].

Routine activity theory (RAT) shares the same rational choice assumption of the theories mentioned above but focuses on the impacts of structural environmental settings rather than offenders' attributes [55]. RAT was initially proposed in sociology to explain predatory crimes [10] and later introduced in the IT security field to understand security breaches [35, 55]. RAT assumes that offenders make rational decisions when they commit criminal activities [10]. The premise is that the probability of criminal activity takes the function of the convergence of motivated offenders, suitable targets, and the absence of capable guardians [10]. RAT can provide insights about how organizations can deliberately reduce their security breaches by analyzing structural situations or interactions with environmental settings (i.e., target suitability and capable guardians) [54]. Therefore, we utilize RAT as an overarching framework to understand the roles of security investments, IT strategies, and their interactions in affecting organizational security breaches.

### Understanding Offender Motivation: Hacker Behavior
Hacker behavior is critical to understand potential offenders in the context of organizational IT security. Hackers' activities and organizations' IT security management are mutually dependent [8]. Literature recognized that hackers are different in terms of their behaviors, objectives, and hacking strategies. Mookerjee et al. [41] identified two categories of hackers: value-seeking versus opportunistic hackers. Value-seeking hackers possess more reliable financial motivations and strategically select suitable targets. They seek organizations' information (e.g., customer, supplier, or strategic plan) that can be sold in a black market to make financial gains. In contrast, opportunistic hackers continually scan online for targets and attack at a rate of randomness independent of targeted organizations' characteristics. Their primary goal is often just "taking a look around," rather than deliberately doing anything harmful to the targets [41]. Similar categorizations can be seen in other IT security literature, such as expert versus novice hackers [40] and profit-driven versus fame-driven hackers [34].

There are two types of attacks that hackers engage in (i.e., mass and targeted attacks [15]), which can be explained by choice and chance models [44]. In mass attacks, hackers follow a path of chance by creating and distributing exploits to compromise as many organizations as possible, without specific targets [15]. On the contrary, hackers with targeted attacks converge to a path of choice and select specific targets based on their anticipated efforts and gains [8, 41]. T
argeted attacks can be vulnerability-based or value-based [15]. Hackers with vulnerability-based attacks target organizations with underprotected systems or vulnerabilities [12]. The vulnerability information can be accessed from hacker communities or purchased from illegitimate online marketplaces [41]. For value-based attacks, hackers select a target based on its value, especially financial value [15]. Mass and vulnerability-based attacks use generic exploits, while value-based attacks require hackers to develop highly customized exploits [44].

Potential attacks that an organization will encounter are different in terms of potential hackers and attacks, as summarized in **Figure 1. Potential attacks that organizations may face.**

Opportunistic hackers are not likely to perform value-based attacks, and value-seeking hackers are not likely to use mass attacks, given their different objectives. Opportunistic hackers with mass attacks randomly select targets and are more easily detected and deterred. If opportunistic hackers perform vulnerability-based attacks, they will try to find organizational vulnerabilities easily accessed (maybe learned from hacker communities or blogs). Given the low complexity of opportunistic hackers' hacking behaviors, their vulnerability-based attacks are relatively easier for organizations to address. However, value-seeking hackers with vulnerability-based attacks are more likely to strategically exploit organizational vulnerabilities learned from hacking communities or even purchase vulnerability information in the black market, thereby increasing the difficulty for organizations to address. Value-seeking hackers identify the most valuable targets with value-based attacks and diligently use customized hacks until achieving their goals. Thus, it is much more difficult to detect and deter value-seeking hackers undertaking value-based attacks.

## Organizational IT Strategies Infer Target Suitability
An organization's IT strategies (e.g., digitalization and network embeddedness) infer target suitability since they are positively associated with the value, visibility, and accessibility dimensions of target suitability.<sup>1</sup>

### Digitalization Increases Target Suitability
Given the symbolic and malleable nature of digital systems and local business practices, digital technologies are becoming mutually reshaped and inseparable [42]. In the digitalization process, digital technologies are "intrinsically embedded into the fabric of local practices and conditions" [18, p. 850]. An organization's digitalization level reflects the extent to which it uses digital technologies and artifacts in its products, services, and business processes [37] and builds digital infrastructure to support and drive its business operations and innovation [52].

An organization's performance can be enhanced through digitalization, increasing the organization's value as a suitable target for the following reasons. First, the use of digital technologies can improve the organization's performance by enhancing its revenue growth through new value propositions, sales channels, marketing, and the improvement of customer lifecycles [38], reducing costs of operations, administration, and marketing [38], and improving capabilities of performance, customer, and process management [39]. Second, digital infrastructure's layered modular architecture enables generativity mechanisms, fostering digital innovation [58]. Third, in highly digitalized organizations, most products, services, business processes, and associated informational assets are digital, effectively used through data analytics to derive additional insights and obtain business value.

An organization's digitalization increases its visibility and accessibility. Digital systems and infrastructures do not have physical weight [57]. Digital files thus are more easily collected and transformed than a physical product [57]. The afforded data and information assets in digital systems are more visible, accessible, and vulnerable for motivated offenders [35]. IT security is hard to separate from digital technologies [41]. Organizations with higher digitalization levels have a heightened need to protect their information [47]. A higher level of digitalization is associated with an increased number of "insiders" who have valid username and password interacting with the organizational information assets [55]. Hence, highly digitalized organizations are more likely to have vulnerabilities exploited by hackers and diffused through a target population [40].

### Network Embeddedness Increases Target Suitability
Organizations are directly interconnected to vendors and indirectly connected to other organizations in the same market through IT outsourcing, forming an affiliation network where both firms and their vendors are incorporated into the same network (referred to as the firm-vendor network hereafter). Sociologists believe that organizational processes, structures, and routines are embedded in the social context [49]. Embedded ties increase organizations' abilities to access talent, knowledge, resources, and information [26], facilitate organizational learning about market conditions and the use of digital systems [46], and signal various aspects of organizational reputation such as the user behaviors of digital systems, the trustworthiness and reliability of potential partners, and performance benchmarks [45]. Hence, the network embeddedness level positively infers the value of an organization as a target.

Information can be transferred through embedded ties, which increases the effectiveness of information sharing throughout the network [53]. Also, network embeddedness infers technical and social compatibility among different network members [9]. For instance, various vendors' systems are consolidated if a focal firm simultaneously adopts their IT systems. In this scenario, the focal firm will serve as a connecting node where the information in different vendors' systems is interconnected. More noticeable, if various firms contract with the same vendor, data and systems are likely to be compatible. Also, the use of IT systems will result in soft-skill resources and use patterns, forming the foundation of social compatibility [9]. Therefore, firms' embeddedness in a firm-vendor network will pose systems interdependency risks [3, 25], which asserts that organizational IT security risks are subject to the behaviors of the focal firm and others who are interconnected to it [3]. Interdependent security risks have been uncovered in previous IT security studies [4, 25, 30]. Hackers can exploit the vulnerabilities of the targeted firm and others interconnected to it.

Kunreuther and Heal [30] demonstrated that firms are more incentivized and likely to underinvest in IT security protection when their IT security risks are interdependent with an increased number of other firms. Embedded ties can fertilize the diffusion of vulnerabilities [51] and reduce the cycle of vulnerability disclosure [40]. An attack on the digital systems of a highly embedded firm that exploits vulnerabilities will enable the hacker to influence many interconnected firms at once [3, 51]. Hence, network embeddedness triggers an organization's information assets' visibility and accessibility, increasing its target suitability.

## Organizational IT Security Investments as a Technological Guardian
A capable guardian in the RAT framework refers to an object or person that protects targets from attacks or crimes [10]. The presence or proximity of guardians will discourage attacks or crimes [55]. Capable guardians are represented by physical security measures such as alarm systems, lighting, and security cameras in a predatory crime context [10]. In the IT security context, capable guardians are conceptualized as the protection mechanisms around information systems to deter and prevent security breaches [57]. Safeguarding sensitive data and informational assets is one of the most common motivations for organizations' IT security investments [33]. Firms are subject to different extents of regulations on security protection [1] and adopt mandatory IT security systems to protect their essential data, information, and technology assets [32] as guided. Depending on organizations' strategic orientation and contingent factors, they may further invest in new IT security protection systems with state-of-the-art IT security features [1].

IT security protection systems serving as technological guardians [57] are often placed around other IT systems that enable business processes [55]. Many security protection systems are used in organizations, including anti-virus software, single sign-on technology, data encryption, Internet firewalls, spyware filters, non-biometric user authentication systems, intrusion detection, fingerprint authentication, and iris scanning systems, among others [1, 32]. These protection systems are designed and adopted to safeguard organizations' information assets by detecting, deterring, and preventing (potential) security failures [55]. Criminological theories demonstrate that preventive security software can deter insiders and hackers from undertaking criminal behaviors, reducing computer abuse [14]. This is consistent with resource-based views, indicating that organizations with more IT security resources will improve their security performance by enhancing organizational security capabilities [33].

## Hypothesis: IT Strategies, Security Investments, and Organizational Security Breaches
RAT assumes a steady supply of motivated offenders, and variations in criminal activities are mainly caused by changes in the structured situation [10]. Prior studies have focused on the direct impacts of target suitability and capable guardians [35, 55]. RAT's premise is that criminal activities are causally predicted by the convergence of target suitability and the absence of capable guardians given the steady supply of motivated offenders. Although organizations' IT strategies infer an increased target suitability level in our research context, their likelihood of experiencing security breaches can be deliberately manipulated through IT security protection systems' investments. This introduces the fact that IT strategies cannot solely determine organizations' security breaches; instead, IT strategies and security investments jointly influence security breaches. Building on the RAT perspective, we utilize hacker behaviors (i.e., offender motivation) as one of the underlying mechanisms when theorizing this joint effect. **Figure 2** depicts our research model.

Since opportunistic hackers and hackers with a mass attack approach are less strategic and tend to select targets randomly, organizations with different IT strategies have an equal chance of experiencing opportunistic hackers and mass attacks. In contrast, value-seeking hackers and hackers with vulnerability-based and value-based attacks are more motivated by gains and strategically select targets. Thus, they are more likely to target organizations with higher digitalization and network embeddedness because of their higher target suitability. This is also demonstrated in practice. For example, according to the *2019 Ransomware Marketplace* report<sup>2</sup>, Coveware found two prominent strategies that attackers (e.g., Ryuk and Sodinokibi variants) undertook: (1) targeting larger organizations since they have ample data assets (i.e., stored in digital systems); and (2) attacking a larger number of organizations on the same network through their IT vendors. Hence, organizations with low digitalization and network embeddedness will have a preponderance of opportunistic hackers and mass attacks, while organizations that are highly digitized and embedded in the outsourcing network experience all types of hackers and attacks.

Consequently, organizations with lower levels of digitalization (or network embeddedness) will find it easier to use IT security protection systems to detect and deter their potential attacks due to the typical non-monetary motivation of opportunistic hackers, the generic exploits of hacking programs, and the path of chance in hacking patterns. In contrast, although the increase of IT security protection systems discourages opportunistic hackers and mass attacks, the effectiveness of these security protection systems for value-seeking hackers is hindered. The reasons include value-seeking hackers' strategic target selection, strong motivations, utilization of customized exploits, the persistence of hacking activities, and more invested efforts such as purchasing relevant information.

> "... [value-seeking] hackers are getting more and more sophisticated. ... Cybercriminals are experts at shifting and evolving their attack vectors to create maximum damage and return. ... [value-seeking] hackers will lurk, testing perimeters and often laying dormant until the right vulnerability is found to then launch an attack." â Emil Sayegh, CEO, Ntirety<sup>3</sup>

In addition to external security threats, organizational security breaches might originate from internal employees [32]. Organizations invest in security systems such as biometric security authentication, identity management, and single sign-on to prevent internal malicious and non-malicious security risks. For malicious insiders, higher digitalization and network embeddedness levels motivate them due to the higher potential payoffs and more significant possible system vulnerabilities. For internal security risks that are accidental, such as physical device loss and unintended disclosure, the more digital information creates more opportunities for employees to make unintentional mistakes. Organizations that are profoundly embedded in the firm-vendor network increase data transmission among different vendors' systems and the complexity of employees' usage of different systems, thereby causing additional risks of internal usage errors. Therefore, we hypothesize that:

**Hypothesis 1 (H1)**: An organization's IT security investments and IT strategies jointly affect its likelihood of security breaches, such that digitalization (H1A) and embeddedness in the IT outsourcing network (H1B) weaken the effectiveness of security investments on reducing organizational security breaches.

## Research Methodology

### Data
We choose the U.S. healthcare sector as the research context, which has been utilized in many prior IT security studies [e.g., 1, 27, 31-33]. We collected hospitals' security breach data from the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse website, which lists publicly announced breaches since 2005 and has been employed as a single information source in recent IT security studies, especially research related to the U.S. hospitals' data breaches [e.g., 1, 48]. We gathered the U.S. hospitals' demographic and IT characteristics data from the HIMSS Analyticsâ¢ Database [1, 2, 27, 32], which provides detailed information on hospital health IT adoption (such as electronic health records [EHRs] and security applications) and hospital characteristics (such as hospital location, size, and financial performance). The number of hospitals with detailed information in the database ranges from 4,010 in 2005 to 5,467 in 2013. We merged the data collected from these sources and constructed a panel dataset. We dropped panels with gaps for empirical identification considerations. Our final sample includes 45,461 hospital-year observations for 5,738 U.S. hospitals during 2005-2013.<sup>4</sup>

### Measurement

#### Security Breaches
Given that most hospitals do not have more than one security breach in a year, the dependent variable *Breach<sub>it</sub>* is coded as 1 if hospital *i* had a security breach at year *t*, and 0 otherwise [1, 32, 36].

#### IT Security Investments
We used the number of active IT security systems of hospital *i* at year *t* to represent its IT security investments [1, 32], denoting as *ITSec<sub>it</sub>*. The set of IT security systems includes antivirus software, single sign-on technology, data encryption, Internet firewalls, spyware filters, non-biometric user authentication systems, intrusion detection, ID management, fingerprint authentication, and iris scanning systems.

#### Digitalization
Prior literature has operationalized the digitalization process of hospitals as their adoption of EHR systems [2]. EHRs are identified as conduits for cost efficiency and healthcare quality enhancement, pushing information technologies that support health information digitalization [6]. Therefore, we use the number of EHR systems that are live and operational in hospital *i* at year *t* to measure the variable *Digitalization<sub>it</sub>* [2].<sup>5</sup>

#### Network Embeddedness
We constructed the two-mode affiliation network concerning hospitals' affiliated relationships with their EHR vendors. Each firm (i.e., a hospital or a vendor) was treated as a node, and the link was defined when a hospital implements and operates an EHR system provided by a vendor. We used betweenness centrality to operationalize the hospital's network embeddedness, which refers to the extent to which the hospital stands between EHR vendors and other hospitals, indicating that more information will pass through the hospital's digital systems.<sup>6</sup> Since hospitals' betweenness centrality scores have a highly skewed distribution and 81.68 percent of observations have zero values, we transform it into a binary variable, that is, *Embeddedness<sub>it</sub>* equals 1 if a hospital *i*âs betweenness centrality is greater than zero at year *t*, and otherwise 0.

#### Control Variables
We control for two sets of variables that may influence organizational security breaches: (1) factors influencing a hospital's likelihood of experiencing security attacks (i.e., target suitability), and (2) covariates that affect a hospital's ability to deter security attacks (i.e., capable guardians). Many hospitals belong to a healthcare system to exploit benefits such as scale economy, resource sharing, and reputational spillover effects [1]. Hospitals operating in a larger healthcare system may be more attractive to attackers as security breaches in one hospital could easily affect others within the same healthcare system. Thus, we control the variable *HealthSystemSize<sub>it</sub>*, which is measured by the number of healthcare entities belonging to the same healthcare system with hospital *i* at year *t*. Also, hospitals' financial revenue influences the potential returns for hackers' attacks, which may significantly affect hospitals' targetability. We create the variable *Revenue<sub>it</sub>* to represent hospital *i*âs total dollar amount of net operational revenue at year *t*.

Prior IT security literature has acknowledged that several demographic characteristics affect hospitals' security vulnerabilities and deterring capabilities. Older hospitals often have more legacy systems, increasing external and internal security threats, and decreasing the complexity of safeguarding information. Larger hospitals are more visible entities, posing more significant security risks [1]. Academic hospitals focused more on educating future healthcare practitioners and conducting research [1], thus are expected to pay additional attention to securing healthcare information. Hospital ownership also signifies hospitals' sense of security responsibilities and contextual understanding of physical devices. Hence, we include four hospital demographic characteristics. *Age<sub>it</sub>* refers to the number of years that hospital *i* has been operating at year *t*. *HospitalSize<sub>it</sub>* measures the number of staffed beds in hospital *i* at year *t*. *Academic<sub>it</sub>* is a binary variable representing whether a hospital is academically oriented, which equals 1 if hospital *i* is affiliated with an academic institution at year *t*, and otherwise 0. The binary variable *Ownership<sub>it</sub>* indicates hospitals' ownership structure, coded as 1 if hospital *i* has the ownership of the property at year *t*, and otherwise 0.

Hospitals' IT characteristics infer the richness of digital information, the complexity of performing attacks, and opportunities for internal security failures. For example, hospitals with more computers will have substantially more information in digital format. Implementing diverse data storage devices such as optical disks, network-attached storage, and cloud-based storage impose different levels of employee secure usage activities and external threats. Hospitals' implemented servers and wireless access points can affect the difficulties and possibilities of hacking into the network. Thus, we control for four related IT characteristics. *ITEquipment<sub>it</sub>* is hospital *i*âs number of computers and laptops operated at year *t*. *Storage<sub>it</sub>* refers to the number of data storage types used in hospital *i* at year *t*. The variable *Server<sub>it</sub>* represents hospital *i*âs number of servers in operation at year *t*. The number of wireless access points of hospital *i* at year *t* is denoted as the variable *WirelessAccess<sub>it</sub>*. In addition to investing in IT security protection systems, organizations designate employees to focus on security operations and management. Organizations with more IT security employees have more substantial human capital potentially dedicated to deterring security breaches. We thus control for *SecurityEmployee<sub>it</sub>*, which refers to hospital *i*âs number of full-time equivalent security employees at year *t*.

**Table 1** provides descriptive statistics and correlations. We performed the diagnostic checks for multicollinearity by examining the variance inflation factor (VIF). All VIF values are below 2, as shown in **Table 1**, demonstrating that multicollinearity is not of concern.

### Empirical Approach and Model Identification
Consistent with prior literature [e.g., 36] and the RAT lens, we model an organization *i*âs likelihood of experiencing IT security breach at year *t* (*Pr<sub>it</sub>(Breach)*) as the product of its encountered security attacks (*R<sub>it</sub>(attack)*) and its ability to successfully deter these attacks (*D<sub>it</sub>(breach|attack)*). *R<sub>it</sub>(attack)* will be shaped by organizational factors that indicate the extent to which the organization attracts different groups of hackers, such as digitalization level and network embeddedness. We denote these factors as the vector *X<sub>it</sub>*. Similarly, *D<sub>it</sub>(breach|attack)* is a function of factor *Z<sub>it</sub>* that affects organizations' security protection abilities such as technical systems (i.e., *ITSec*) and designated security employees. In this model, we assume that hospitals' security breaches are observable and fully detected. To avoid the potential reverse causality issue, we lagged all regressors one year. In other words, we collected data for the dependent variable (i.e., security breach) of 2006-2014 and independent and control variables of 2005-2013. Mathematically, we have:

\[
E[\operatorname{Pr}_{i,t+1}(\text{Breach})] = R_{it}(\text{attack}) \times D_{it}(\text{breach} \mid \text{attack})
\]
\[
= f_1(\alpha + \beta_1 X_{it}) \times f_2(\eta + \beta_2 Z_{it})
\]
\[
= F(\beta_0 + \beta_1 X_{it} + \beta_2 Z_{it})
\]

There are several econometrics approaches to identify the model. We start with the linear probability model (LPM) since it has superiority in testing interactive effects, controlling for unobserved heterogeneity using fixed effects, and addressing endogeneity concerns. **Columns (1) and (2)** in **Table 2** present the linear fixed effects model estimation with all control variables, hospital fixed effects, and year fixed effects. However, LPM has its drawbacks, such as the predicted probabilities that may be outside the range of zero to one and the heteroskedastic error term [56]. A logit regression model can relax the normally distributed error terms assumption and overcome LPM estimationâs shortcomings [56]. Thus, we estimated a panel data logit model using random-effects estimation<sup>7</sup>, as shown in **Columns (3) and (4)** in **Table 2**. Furthermore, since our events of interest (i.e., security breaches) are rare compared to the nonevents in the sample, a conventional logit estimation may suffer from small-sample bias and under-estimate the security breach probabilities [28]. We thus estimated a rare event logit model and reported the results in **Columns (5) and (6)** in **Table 2**.

Although we have considered many time-variant hospital characteristics and included hospital and year fixed effects to control time-invariant unobserved heterogeneity, some time-variant unobserved factors may bias our estimated results. We used an instrumental variable (IV) approach to address the potential endogeneity of IT security investments. The ideal IVs should be correlated with hospitalsâ IT security investments but not related to the error term of the security breach probability estimation. We identified three appropriate IVs. First, strategy research commonly argued that organizations depend on their resources when deciding strategic investments [24]. As Kwon and Johnson [32] argued, hospitalsâ financial capital and employees significantly influence their IT security investments. These two factors are not likely to directly correlate with hospitalsâ IT security breach risks, especially after controlling other factors such as hospital revenue, size, and IT security employees. We thus use variables of total IT budgets in dollars amount (*ITBudget<sub>it</sub>*) and total full-time equivalent IT employees (*ITEmployee<sub>it</sub>*) as IVs for *ITSec<sub>it</sub>*. Also, prior literature has commonly used average industry investments as an instrument for a focal organizationâs investment decisions since their peers influence organizationsâ strategic decisions, and the industry average investment level is exogenous to the focal organizationâs decisions [23]. We thus create the third IV, *StateAvgITSec<sub>it</sub>*, which is the average IT security investments of all hospitals in the same state with hospital *i* at year *t*.

We estimated a panel data two-stage least square (2SLS) model with fixed effects, as shown in **Column (7)** in **Table 2**. In the first stage, all three IVs are significantly associated with hospitalsâ IT security investments (*F*(3,5269)=193.25, *p*=0.00), demonstrating IVsâ relevance. The Hansen *J* statistic is not significant (*J*=2.53, *p*=0.28), validating the overidentification restrictions. We then add the interaction terms into the model. Since we have three endogenous terms (i.e., *ITSec<sub>it</sub>*, *ITSec<sub>it</sub>* Ã *Digitalization<sub>it</sub>*, and *ITSec<sub>it</sub>* Ã *Embeddedness<sub>it</sub>*), we need at least four IVs to satisfy the overidentification restrictions. Following the arguments related to organizational resources in determining security investments, we include hospitalsâ number of employees as the fourth IV. The intuition is that organizations with more employees will have greater resources to invest in security protection systems, but not necessarily attract more security attacks, after controlling other factors such as hospital revenue and size. **Column (8)** in **Table 2** reports the estimation results. All four IVs are significantly correlated with hospitalsâ IT security investments (*F*(4,5269)=154.56, *p*=0.00). The Hansen *J* statistic is not significant (*J*=0.19, *p*=0.66). Hence, the four IVs are valid for the three endogenous variables in the estimation.

## Results

### Results of Hypothesis Testing
As depicted in **Table 2**, the results consistently show that the interaction between IT security investments and digitalization significantly affects the likelihood of organizational security breaches. As shown in **Figure 3**, IT security investments negatively affect the likelihood of organizational security breaches when the organizationâs digitalization is low. On the contrary, the increase in IT security investments is associated with an increase in organizational security breaches. **H1A**, therefore, is statistically supported. The estimation from the fixed effect modelâs estimation, as shown in **Column (2)**, indicates that the digitalization levelâs critical threshold is around 2.44 EHR systems.<sup>8</sup> In other words, after implementing three or more EHR systems (i.e., out of the five EHRs in total), hospitals would do well if they pay attention to the possible positive impacts of IT security investments on their likelihood of increased security breaches.

**Table 2** shows (in **Columns 1, 3, 5, 7**) that the direct effects of digitalization and network embeddedness on organizationsâ security breaches are generally not statistically significant. This result confirms our RAT-based theoretical development, that is, IT strategies do not solely determine organizationsâ security breaches, rather the joint effects between IT strategies and security investments are more meaningful in causally predicting security breaches. With stronger causal identification using 2SLS, we found a positive relationship between IT security investments and organizational security breaches (*Î²*=0.0331, *p*<0.01), as shown in **Column (7)** in **Table 2**. It is also worth noting that the coefficient on *ITSec<sub>it</sub>* estimated using fixed effects and logit models have contradictory signs. Furthermore, after addressing the endogeneity of *ITSec<sub>it</sub>*, the moderating effect of network embeddedness on the relationship between IT security investments and security breaches (*Î²*=-0.0765, *p*=n.s.) become insignificant, as shown in **Column (8)** in **Table 2**. Hence, **H1B** is not supported. The positive direct effects of security investments and the insignificance of **H1B** might be due to the different impacts of investing in various security systems on different breach types. This motivates us to conduct a more granular analysis to identify possible mechanisms discussed in the next section.<sup>9</sup>

### Additional Analysis and Results
Prior security literature has recognized that organizational security breaches are caused by failures from both internal (e.g., malicious insider threats, physical loss, or unintentional disclosure) and external (e.g., hackers), and they vary in terms of source, motivation, and intensity [31]. For example, organizational insiders (with valid access to the system) cause internal breaches, which are more frequent than external breaches caused by malicious hackers. Despite similar harm, organizations often focus more on managing external security threats than internal security risks [32]. While prior literature has examined the impacts of IT security investments on organizationsâ internal and external breaches [32], investments on types of security protection systems are yet to be distinguished. In other words, prior studies have primarily aggregated all implemented IT security protection systems to measure an organizationâs overall security investments [e.g., 1, 32].

However, organizations adopt various security countermeasure systems in safeguarding their digital information. TNC systems, including anti-virus software, data encryption, Internet firewall, intrusion detection systems, and spam/spyware filter, are primarily implemented to prevent, detect, or deter malicious external attacks on the organizationâs network. Organizations take advantage of IAM systems to manage internal threats, including fingerprint scanning, identity management, iris scanning, single sign-on, and user authentication, to govern insidersâ access. Following the categorization criteria used in Kwon and Johnson [32], we create two binary variables, *ExternalBreach<sub>it</sub>* and *InternalBreach<sub>it</sub>*, to distinguish the types of security breaches. Specifically, *ExternalBreach<sub>it</sub>* equals 1 if hospital *i* reported a breach caused by external hackers, and otherwise 0 at year *t*. *InternalBreach<sub>it</sub>* equals 1 if hospital *i* has a breach occurred from inside the organization such as malicious insider threats, physical loss, and unintended disclosure, and otherwise 0 at year *t*. The explanatory variable *ITSec_IAM<sub>it</sub>* refers to the number of IAM systems in hospital *i* at year *t*. *ITSec_TNC<sub>it</sub>* is measured by the number of TNC security systems operated by hospital *i* at year *t*.

We estimated several models using the 2SLS identification with fixed effects using the same set of IVs in the hypothesis testing. To explain the positive direct effect of security investments on security breaches, we fit two separate models using *ExternalBreach<sub>it</sub>* and *InternalBreach<sub>it</sub>* as dependent variables and include regressors of *ITSec_IAM<sub>it</sub>* and *ITSec_TNC<sub>it</sub>* as well as all independent and control variables. **Column (1)** in **Table 3** demonstrates that TNC systems indeed reduce organizationsâ likelihood of external breaches caused by hackers (*Î²*=-0.0175, *p*<0.1), which is consistent with our intuitions and findings of prior studies [32]. As shown in **Column (3)**, organizationsâ investments in IAM systems reduce their likelihood of experiencing internal breaches (*Î²*=-0.1197, *p*<0.1), while TNC systems are not significantly associated with internal breaches (*Î²*=0.0242, *p*=n.s.). This result confirms the objective of deterring internal threats through IAM systems.

However, results in **Column (1)** also indicate that organizationsâ investments in IAM systems increase their likelihood of experiencing external breaches (*Î²*=0.1057, *p*<0.05). There are several plausible reasons explaining this seemingly counterintuitive result. First, value-seeking hackers may interpret an organizationâs access and authentication control as an information cue in their target selection, that is, higher IAM investments signal the organizational importance of information assets [1]. Organizations signal their IT security investments in at least two scenarios: (1) organizations disclose their adoption of advanced security systems to build market reputation [1]; and (2) IT security vendors may disclose such information to demonstrate their superiority in the hope of attracting new customers [29]. Building on the signaling argument made in Angst et al. [1], our results expressly point out that IAM security systems serve as the signals to external hackers rather than TNC security systems. Second, different from TNC, IAM systems contain important user access information and thereby are more likely to be used as a point of attack. The Chief Information Security Officer at an IAM vendor SailPoint explicitly expressed that âthe easiest way to get into a server room is to break into the key cabinet. ... Likewise, breaking into an organizationâs IAM system will give a hacker access to every IT system within that organization.â<sup>10</sup> Third, organizations often need a centralized IAM system to manage privileges and system access. System integration may be problematic when organizations rely on several different IAM systems. For example, although one type of IAM system could block invalid access, malicious attackers may use alternative ways supported by other IAM systems to get through the authentication. In this way, with too many IAM systems, organizations are likely to experience more external breaches.<sup>11</sup>

Establishing the direct effects of different IT security systems on internal and external breaches, we add the moderator *Embeddedness<sub>it</sub>* into the equations to explain the unsupported **H1B** in our hypothesis testing.<sup>12</sup> First, since coefficients on both *ITSec_IAM<sub>it</sub>* and *ITSec_TNC<sub>it</sub>* are significant in predicting external breaches, we add their interactions with *Embeddedness<sub>it</sub>*. As depicted in **Column (2)** in **Table 3**, the results indicate that organizationsâ network embeddedness weakens IT security investmentsâ impacts on security breaches. The negative moderating effect of network embeddedness on the relationship between TNC systems and external breaches (*Î²*=0.0342, *p*<0.1) is consistent with our **H1B**. Network embeddedness also weakens the signaling effects of IAM systems on external breaches (*Î²*=-0.1032, *p*<0.05). The intuitive assumption is that organizations with greater network embeddedness would unsurprisingly need more IAM systems, thereby weakening the signals of more valuable assets to protect. Second, since only the coefficient on *ITSec_IAM<sub>it</sub>* is significant in predicting internal breaches, we add its interaction with *Embeddedness<sub>it</sub>*. **Column (4)** in **Table 3** demonstrates that the effectiveness of IAM in reducing internal breaches is more robust for organizations with greater network embeddedness (*Î²*=-0.0259, *p*<0.05). The reason may be that high network embeddedness increases the organizationâs system technical complexity, reducing internal security errors.

In sum, the granular analysis, distinguishing types of breaches and security investments, potentially reconciles the inconsistent mechanisms of security investmentsâ impacts on security breachesâi.e., we demonstrate the guardianship role of IAM systems on internal threats and TNC systems on external threats, as well as the signaling effects of IAM on external breaches.<sup>13</sup> Network embeddedness also interacts with the impacts of different security investments on internal and external security threats differently, explaining the insignificance of **H1B**.

## Robustness Checks
Beyond the post-hoc analysis to enrich our insights, we conduct a series of empirical tests to explore the resultsâ robustness. First, we assume that all security breaches are publicly announced in our main regression models. However, some hospitals, especially those in the states without security breach notification law before HIPAA imposed federal requirements in 2009 [27], may under-report their security breaches. To address this potential bias, we estimated a bivariate Probit with a partial observability model [43]. **Columns (1) and (2)** in **Table 4** report the results of the two equations estimated using the bivariate Probit model. Furthermore, security breaches vary in the number of records compromised, and breaches with more breached records may be more visible to the public. We ran robustness checks using the alternative coding of the dependent variable, that is, the log of the total number of records breaches. We fit the 2SLS estimation with fixed effects and present the results in **Column (3)** in **Table 4**. Overall, the alternative models show consistent results with our main analysis.

## Discussion

### Implications for Research
This research adds theoretical insights on the role of organizational IT security investments. Past IT security literature has demonstrated the contradictory mechanisms (i.e., guardianship and signaling effects) of security investments and produce inconsistent results concerning IT security investmentsâ impacts on organizational security breaches [1, 32, 48]. Beyond the plausible explanations identified in prior studies, we advocate the importance of recognizing how IT security investments interacting with risk factors caused by IT strategies determine organizational security performance. Organizations with different IT strategies will motivate heterogeneous groups of hackers with different behavioral patterns and pose different opportunities for non-malicious security errors, thereby causing the differential impacts of their IT security investments. Tackling the mechanisms of joint effects between IT security investments and IT strategies, we further demonstrate that distinguishing types of security protection systems and security breach types contribute to the inconsistent impacts of security investments seen in past research.

Our emphasis on the joint effects of security investments and IT strategies motivate the exploration and theorization of the security-IT alignment perspective in future research. An IS research topic attracting persistent attention, IT strategic alignment, argues that organizations will achieve better performance when their IT resources are appropriately aligned with business strategies [11]. Accordingly, researchers could generically define security-IT alignment as the fit between organizationsâ IT security resources (e.g., IT security protection systems) and IT resources (e.g., IT infrastructure, technical and managerial IT skills, IT knowledge assets). IT security strategies are not standalone decisions for any organization. The primary purpose is to safeguard the information embedded in organizational digital systems and serve as a strategic enabler of building business capabilities. Thus, IT security investments can achieve the best payoff only when they are appropriately aligned with the organizationâs IT characteristics. In this study, we empirically confirm that the effects of IT security investments on security breaches depend on the organizationâs IT strategies, such as digitalization and IT outsourcing. We believe that this research offers a starting point and encourages future research to conceptualize the security-IT alignment construct, investigate the antecedents and consequence of security-IT alignment, and possibly examine the three-way strategic alignment among business, IT, and security strategies. This line of studies will contribute to the growing literature of IT security management and IT alignment.

In reconciling the contrary mechanisms of organizational IT security investments, we responded to calls for research to explore other possible explanations about the link between organizational IT security investments and security performance. We also recognize the potential for additional possible explanations, such as the design of IT security architectures [7] and organizationsâ vulnerability awareness and security protection incentives [59]. For example, layered security architecture design with multiple security technologies amplifies the requirement for proper configuration since each security technologyâs effectiveness is mutually affected by other security technologies [7]. Therefore, organizations with different IT security architecture designs are likely to have heterogeneous security performance from IT security investments. This research, along with prior studies, employs a measure of IT security systems adoption and investigates the impacts of IT security investments at an organizational level. However, the architectural relationship between IT security systems and other operational and strategic systems might also be significant in understanding IT security investmentsâ impacts. Future research may revisit the relationship by examining the dyadic of security systems and other IT systems.

### Implications for Practice
One premise of our results is that organizational IT security strategy should be fitted with IT strategies. Security managers should recognize the co-existence of the contradictory mechanisms of security investments, that is, IT security systems may serve as technological guardians and may signal the importance of organizational information assets and intent on security protection. With different IT strategies, organizations attract different groups of potential offenders with heterogeneous behavioral patterns, resulting in different security investments. For example, for organizations with a higher digitalization level, value-seeking hackers may interpret organizational security investments as positive signals to be a suitable target. In this case, organizations should not only rely on technological security protection systems but also allocate strategic attention to other security enhancement approaches such as behavioral control.

Relating to the mixed mechanisms of organizationsâ IT security protection systems, our results demonstrate the importance of understanding the effects of different types of security systems on different security breach types. For example, TNC security systems such as anti-virus software, data encryption, and spyware filter reduce external breaches. IAM systems such as biometric scanning, authentication, and identity management decrease internal breaches. However, higher investments in IAM systems may signal the organizationâs valuable assets needing protection, thereby increasing external breaches. One possible way to reduce the signaling role of IAM systems on external breaches is to increase the embeddedness in the firm-vendor network. By increasing the technical complexity of internal systems, network embeddedness will also amplify the deterrent effect of IAM on internal breaches. The tension of network embeddedness also weakens the negative impacts of TNC systems on external breaches since it poses systems interdependency risks, feeds the diffusion of vulnerabilities, and reduces the cycle of vulnerability disclosure.

Our theoretical analysis of hacker behaviors also provides practical guidelines for executives on how to assess potential attacks. Organizations with detection systems should analyze their traffic from both internal and external sources [41], which could help organizations categorize types of hackers and attack approaches. Different groups of hackersâ mechanisms of selecting targets, objectives, and the difficulty of detecting and responding to them are heterogeneous. Our framework of potential attacks concerning these two dimensions provides companies a fundamental tool to understand the external environment and perform an initial assessment of target suitability and organizational risks.

## Limitations and Future Research
We acknowledge some limitations and provide directions for future research. First, we did not directly test hacker behaviors with empirical data in a specific context. Future studies could further investigate how the variation of hackersâ behaviors, activities, and motivation affects organizational IT security performance. Also, we use an organizationâs adoption of IT security systems to measure IT security investments, which may be hard to adequately account for the effective deployment and use of security systems in the organizationâs operations. Future research could examine the effects of actual IT security systems usage on organizational security performance. Furthermore, we only observe the actual occurrence of security breaches, which also may be under-reported by some hospitals. Although we have made significant efforts to address the potential biases caused by such unobserved security attacks and partial observability of security breaches, future research might employ other methodologies such as field study and qualitative approach to address these challenges.

## Conclusions
IT security investments are recognized as crucial organizational strategic decisions, but their impact on security breaches remains unresolved in the current literature. This research examines how IT security investments and IT strategies (i.e., digitalization and network embeddedness) jointly influence security breaches. Our longitudinal analysis of U.S. hospitals demonstrates that IT security investments reduce security breaches only when the organizationâs digitalization level is low. We find a positive relationship between security investments and security breaches for organizations with high digitalization levels. Our post-hoc analysis indicates that this is mainly caused by IAM security systemsâ signaling effects on external hackers. We also confirm that TNC security systems reduce external breaches and the deterrent effect of IAM on internal breaches. Network embeddedness weakens the negative effect of TNC on external breaches but amplifies the negative relationship between IAM and internal breaches. Our findings highlight the critical moderating role of IT strategies and different security protection systems in reducing security breaches from different sources. We theoretically offer a nuanced understanding of organizational IT security investments and explain the contradictory findings concerning the relationship between security investments and breaches in prior studies. Furthermore, we delineate âwhenâ and âhowâ IT security investments curtail breaches, informing business managers in making IT security investment decisions.

## Notes
1. In the RAT framework, *Value* refers to the assessment of the gain of undertaking criminal activity. Although the value is often considered and operationalized as financial benefit, potential offenders may seek enjoyment and social value. *Visibility* refers to the likelihood that potential offenders know the existence and location of a target. The visibility of a target is positively associated with offendersâ suitability since the visibility forms the exposure factor of a target to potential offenders. *Accessibility* measures an offenderâs ability to access the target and get away from the location and the scene of the crime. A target with a higher level of accessibility is more suitable for theft.

4. Note that not all hospitals filled HIMSS survey every year. Thus, the number of unique hospitals in our final unbalanced panel data is greater than the number of surveyed hospitals in some years.
5. HIMSS has surveyed hospitalsâ adoption of five main types of EHR systems: Clinical Data Repository, Clinical Decision Support Systems, Computerized Physician Order Entry, Order Entry, and Physician Documentation.
6. We also run robustness checks using eigenvector centrality and degree centrality to measure hospitalsâ network embeddedness. The results are consistent with our primary analysis. We do not report them due to space limits, but they are available upon request.
7. We do not report the fixed effects logit (i.e., conditional logit) model since it only uses observations of hospitals that have experienced security breaches in some years, which only keeps 3570 observations (i.e., 7.85 percent of the full sample) in the estimation. However, the results with the conditional logit model estimation are consistent with our hypothesis testing.
8. To derive the critical threshold level based on **Column (2)**, we compute the partial differentiation

\[
\frac{\partial \operatorname{Pr}(\text{Breach}_{i,t+1})}{\partial \text{ITSec}_{it}} = -0.0025 + 0.0029 \times \log(1 + \text{Digitalization}_{it}) - 0.0059 \times \log(1 + \text{Embeddedness}_{it}).
\]

Let \(\log(1 + \text{Embeddedness}_{it})\) equals to its mean value 0.1831. The conditions when *ITSec<sub>it</sub>* positively influence the likelihood of security breaches is calculated as:

\[
\frac{\partial \operatorname{Pr}(\text{Breach}_{i,t+1})}{\partial \text{ITSec}_{it}} = -0.0025 + 0.0029 \times \log(1 + \text{Digitalization}_{it}) - 0.0059 \times 0.1831 > 0.
\]

We thus have *Digitalization* > 2.4369.

11. We thank an anonymous reviewer for suggesting this possible explanation from IAM system integration or centralization perspective.
12. We did not discuss the model including the interaction terms between digitalization and two types of security investments, for two main reasons. First, the moderating effects of digitalization (**H1A**) is supported in hypothesis testing. Second, the results of the moderating effects of digitalization in this granular analysis are identical to the main hypothesis testing. We did not find additional insights and therefore do not discuss it due to space limit.
13. Our results provide an important explanation of the inconsistent findings regarding the impacts of IT security investments on security breaches. In addition to the mechanisms identified in Angst et al. [1], we found that the IT security protection systems used in Angst et al. [1] and Kwon and Johnson [32] are not the same. Kwon and Johnson [32] used all five TNC systems and only one IAM system (i.e., user authentication), and their results are highly consistent with our findings regarding TNCâs negative impacts on external breaches and its insignificant effects on internal breaches. In contrast, Angst et al. [1] used all TNC and IAM systems in their study and found average positive effects of these systems on firmsâ all types of security breaches. Our results found the positive impacts of IAM systems on external breaches. Therefore, our results are qualitatively consistent with prior studies but offer additional explanations to reconcile their inconsistencies.
