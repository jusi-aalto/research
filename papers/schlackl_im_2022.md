#### ABSTRACT

Research on data breaches is scattered across disciplines and methodologies. To help consolidate it, we review 43 articles on data breaches' antecedents and 83 on their consequences. We find eight different categories each for antecedents and consequences. Most research is empirical-quantitative and employs an organizational unit of analysis. Theoretical lenses discovered range from a data breach as organizational crisis to criminological and privacy-specific theories. Our review provides researchers and practitioners with a synthesis of extant research and elaborates on future implications for data breach literature.

### **1. Introduction**

Data breaches have grown increasingly common as businesses have become more reliant on the Internet and digitized processes. Similarly, the costs associated with a data breach have also increased. In 2006, the average data breach in the US cost around 3.5 million USD. By 2020, this cost had increased to 8.64 million, a rise of more than 140% over 14 years [[1](#page-12-0),[2](#page-12-0)]. As data breaches can lead to PR disasters and executive firings, their prevention, detection, and management have become a high priority for managers. In a CEO survey conducted in late 2019, half of all surveyed American CEOs were 'extremely concerned' about cyber threats to their business and listed such threats as the single biggest danger to their companies [\[3\].](#page-12-0) Among cyber threats, data breaches are rated as the most important issue for security managers, as a recent Delphi study of CISO priorities has shown [\[4\]](#page-12-0).

Previous information systems (IS) security literature reviews document a relative absence of data breach research in the basket of eight journals, whereas practitioners emphasized data breaches as their biggest priority [\[4,5](#page-12-0)]. Yet, literature on data breaches exists in multiple disciplines, such as accounting [\[6\]](#page-12-0), finance [\[7\],](#page-12-0) IS [\[8\],](#page-12-0) marketing [\[9\]](#page-12-0), strategy [\[10\]](#page-12-0), and computer science [\[11\]](#page-12-0). This is an apparently paradoxical situation – a wide demand for data breach research from practitioners, little research on data breaches being found among leading IS journals, but a wide breadth of data breach research existing across disciplines. Furthermore, the multidisciplinary nature of prior research means that different fields have studied similar questions and are not fully aware of the others' findings, leaving the literature in a scattered and piecemeal state. This leaves both practitioners and academics with an incomplete picture. Overall, the current state of the data breach literature requires an interdisciplinary review that synthesizes and structures the literature and informs researchers of the extent of prior work.

Data breaches are usually based on a successful exploitation of a vulnerability in a system [[12,13\]](#page-12-0). Beyond technical measures at the system level, they are widely acknowledged to be a managerial and organizational problem [\[14\].](#page-12-0) This is because breach prevention and response go beyond the IT department and involve management and non-IT employees. Accordingly, it is pivotal to understand what happens upstream and downstream from data breaches (i.e., what antecedents lead to them and what consequences follow from them). This dual perspective is recognized by previous information security literature that identified prevention and response as separate paradigms in managing security [\[15\]](#page-12-0), with antecedents corresponding to prevention and consequences to response. From a social science perspective, reviewing antecedents and consequences can also lay the groundwork for a potential future nomological network to explain, predict and understand data breaches and their outcomes. Thus, we compile an interdisciplinary, systematic review to synthesize the literature and provide an overview of what leads to a data breach and what follows from it. To provide a full picture of the literature and help identify gaps for future research, we also report on the theoretical lenses, methods, and data sources used.

In our literature review, we thus answer the following four research questions: 1) What antecedents and consequences of data breaches have been identified in the literature so far? 2) What methods and data sources do research into antecedents and consequences of data breaches

By answering these questions, we contribute to research and practice in a number of ways. For researchers, our review provides an overview of data breach research and concepts developed in the literature. We also map the data sources and theoretical lenses used and describe opportunities for future research based on them. We establish that previous research is centered on organization-centric theoretical lenses and econometric methods and has focused heavily on some concepts, while entirely missing others, such as real effects on breach victims. By providing this overview, we build on Dhillon et al. [\[4\],](#page-12-0) who recently called for more research on data breaches in IS. Answering their call, the future implications identified by us can be a stepping stone for productive future data breach research. This review also goes beyond recent work by Khan et al. [\[14\],](#page-12-0) who built a risk framework from data breach literature. Whereas their article applies a risk management lens to data breaches, we take a meta-perspective towards the literature, map and evaluate topics, theoretical lenses, methods, and data sources. For practitioners, our review provides an overview on different prevention measures and on the effect of seemingly unrelated organizational characteristics on their data breach risk; it also lists possible consequences and thus might be helpful in response planning.

### **2. Background**

This article focuses on the antecedents to and consequences arising from data breaches. In the context of our review, antecedents are general factors associated with, and ideally causally related to, an increased or decreased chance of data breach. Antecedents include the root causes of a data breach (a term sometimes used in computer science literature) [\[4\].](#page-12-0) Notably, antecedents of a data breach are considerably more high-level in distance and scope than the breach's attack vectors or cause and locus, risk management terms that can also be used to categorize breaches [\[14\]](#page-12-0). A consequence is understood as an event or outcome resulting directly from a previously occurred data breach.

The European Commission defines the occurrence of a data breach as "when the data for which your organization is responsible suffers a security incident resulting in a breach of confidentiality, availability, or integrity" [\[16\]](#page-12-0). This definition touches upon all three CIA aspects of information security, namely confidentiality, integrity, and availability [\[17\]](#page-12-0). In scientific literature, *data breach* usually specifically refers to confidentiality violations [\[18](#page-12-0),[19\]](#page-12-0). As pure availability incidents (such as denial-of-service attacks) do not involve any leakage, theft, or manipulation of data, they are fundamentally different from incidents affecting data. To ensure a better focus for the review, pure availability incidents were excluded. In practice, data breaches often violate multiple security dimensions, especially if they occur in an organized manner.

#### **3. Methodology**

To compile a body of relevant articles, two topic-based searches, one each for antecedents and consequences, were performed between October 2020 and January 2021. We searched ABI Inform, the ACM Digital Library, AISeL, and IEEE Xplore. In addition, to ensure completeness with regards to the IS literature, the basket of eight IS journals were also searched individually. A follow-up search was made in early February 2022 to cover literature up to the end of 2021.

#### *3.1. Keywords and database search*

As articles might use alternative terms for data breaches, for example, "security breach" or "data leak", searching for "data breach" only might be overly restrictive [\[14\]](#page-12-0). We thus aimed to use a wide range of keywords in order to find as many potentially relevant articles as possible. Through initial pilot searches, relevant keywords were identified and clustered into three categories. In our search strings, these clusters were connected via ANDs, with the keywords inside a cluster being connected via ORs (following vom Brocke et al. [\[20\]](#page-12-0)). The first cluster covers words roughly describing antecedents/consequences, whereas the second and third combine to various terms for data breaches:

- Antecedents: (risk OR factor OR influence OR determinant OR probability OR threat) AND (data OR security) AND (incident OR leak OR violation OR breach)
- Consequences: (consequences OR cost OR effect OR outcome OR reaction OR impact) AND (data OR security) AND (incident OR leak OR violation OR breach)

The search strings were adapted for the individual databases. For example, some databases limited the length of the search string or the number of operators. In these cases, multiple searches were performed with different subsets of the clusters to generate the overall search string results across multiple searches.

An overview of the search process is depicted in [Fig. 1](#page-2-0). Each database was searched separately for matches with the title, abstract, and the authors' keywords. For ABI inform, keyword search was skipped as it was unavailable. Some articles could not be accessed and thus were not considered for the literature review. No time filters were applied. In total, 9,844 and 12,237 results were returned across all databases for the searches related to antecedents and consequences, respectively. These rather large numbers result from our extensive search strings. Our goal was to be as expansive as possible and allow for a high number of falsepositive results to prevent false negatives from occurring (i.e., we accepted many irrelevant papers in the results to prevent relevant ones from not appearing). Yet, as results are usually returned by relevance, we noticed a "long tail" of thousands of irrelevant articles in our results. Thus, examination of the search results was stopped if out of multiple hundred consecutive articles, not a single one was deemed relevant. This usually occurred after the first 1,500 search results. Thus, we examined 7,675 and 3,566 titles and abstracts, respectively. Relevant articles possibly overlooked would, with reasonable likelihood, have been identified in subsequent forward and backward searches.

### *3.2. Screening and selection of studies*

The screening and selection of the studies was a three-step process. First, in the initial screening, articles returned in the database search were checked for relevance based on whether title and abstract were related to any kind of consequence or antecedent of a data breach. Articles that did not consider breaches as a social science phenomenon but focused exclusively on technical aspects were excluded; this was the case for pure computer science articles dealing with specific vulnerabilities or presenting novel tools or detection methods. Similarly, antecedents to vulnerabilities without any mention of their exploitation in an actual attack or breach were excluded. The literature stream of security policy violations in IS (e.g., [[21,22](#page-12-0)]) was generally excluded due to this criterion. Second-order consequences (e.g., compensation to remedy negative customer reactions to a breach) were also excluded to maintain focus. This screening of the examined results based on title and abstract resulted in preliminary lists of 38 and 163 results for antecedents and consequences, respectively.

In the second step, articles added to the preliminary list after the initial screening were read in full. Out of those, 28 and 62 articles were found to be relevant. Articles at this stage were usually considered irrelevant if they addressed topics close to consequences or antecedents of breaches, but did not focus on those topics in particular, or did not include actual breach references.

Third, based on the relevant articles, forward and backward searches were performed. Forward searches were conducted via Google Scholar, especially for articles cited often or covering aspects very different from

<span id="page-2-0"></span>**Fig. 1.** Overview of Search Process.

other articles. Backward searches were done by studying the bibliographies of the relevant articles, focusing on articles cited in the sections on background and prior literature. During the backward search, the authors noticed a significant overlap of cited articles. This was seen as a strong sign that the backward search can be regarded as complete [\[23\]](#page-12-0). The forward and backward searches revealed 15 and 21 additional articles, respectively. Thus, the total number of articles included in the review was 43 and 83, with four articles being included in both lists.<sup>1</sup>

### *3.3. Coding*

As the searches for antecedents and consequences were independent of one another, they were also coded independently. The codes were developed successively from specific antecedents or consequences mentioned in the article, with a new code being developed every time an existing code could not capture a specific antecedent or consequence. These codes were later visualized in a concept matrix, grouped, and generalized into broader categories [\[23\]](#page-12-0). The first author coded the antecedents and the second author coded the consequences, with both authors reviewing each other's coded tables to ensure mutual understanding and a common procedure. A similar approach was used in the identification of the theoretical lenses, where each article was searched for its mentions of any theory; the theories found were then studied for their commonalities and differences and ultimately grouped into the lenses. The full coding tables are linked in the appendix.

## **4. Results**

In structuring our results, we broadly follow Chu et al. [\[24\]](#page-12-0) who used Durach et al. [\[25\]](#page-12-0)'s framework of addressing questions of "what", "why" and "how". In [Section 4.1,](#page-3-0) the discovered concepts of antecedents and

consequences ("what") are explained. [Section 4.2](#page-6-0) elaborates on the used theories and thematic lenses of the different articles ("why"). [Sections](#page-8-0)  [4.3](#page-8-0) and [4.4](#page-8-0) provide an overview and commentary of the methods and data used ("how"). As the articles reviewed were both numerous and diverse in terms of discipline, method, unit of analysis, and theory, statements will usually be made about groups of articles.

In general, the number of articles published per year has grown for both antecedents and consequences, with a far higher growth occurring in the literature on consequences, especially after 2015. An overview of the growth over time across disciplines can be seen in [Fig. 2 and Fig. 3](#page-3-0). Disciplines were determined based on publication outlet and publisher.<sup>2</sup>

As can be seen in both figures, research on data breaches' antecedents and consequences is centered in IS publications, with most non-IS research appearing in computer science and accounting. Finance and marketing articles appeared solely in the literature on consequences, indicating that these fields may view breach antecedents as outside their scope. Especially in the consequences literature, a growth of articles in other business disciplines can be observed since 2016, with all marketing and accounting articles appearing after this date. Two further observations regarding the development over time are noteworthy. First, the literature was multidisciplinary already by the early 2000s, indicating that research interest has not "grown out" of IS, but instead different disciplines were interested in data breaches very early on. Second, articles on data breaches first appeared in UT-Dallas-listed IS journals in 2005 [\[26\]](#page-12-0) and have been published in them steadily ever since [\[8,12,27](#page-12-0)–33]. Starting in 2017, articles on data breach antecedents or consequences [[7](#page-12-0),[9](#page-12-0)[,34](#page-13-0),[35\]](#page-13-0) also started to appear in UT-Dallas-listed finance, marketing, and accounting journals, indicating that mainstream interest in data breaches beyond IS has grown since the mid-2010s.

<sup>1</sup> Due to the slight overlap between articles covering antecedents and articles covering consequences, for tables listing counts across antecedents, consequences, and both, the total might be less than the sum of both columns. For example, in [Table 4](#page-8-0) there are 21 econometric papers for antecedents, 13 for consequences, and 33 in total, as one paper is included in both categories.

<sup>2</sup> e.g. the Journal of Information Systems (JIS) is published by the American Accounting Association and frequented by accounting faculty, thus, despite its name, we categorized it as an accounting journal.

# *4.1. Concepts*

An overview of the categories of antecedents and consequences can be seen in [Table 1.](#page-4-0) Through the review, for both antecedents and consequences, eight categories of concepts each emerged. For antecedents, these categories could be grouped into preventive measures directly aimed at reducing breach risk, and other factors that unintentionally affect the risk of a data breach. For consequences, these categories were grouped according to whether they affect the breached organization (internal) or whether they affect external stakeholders.

# *4.1.1. Antecedents*

Among the antecedents, eight categories of concepts emerged, the first three of which were preventive measures, whereas the latter five encompassed factors affecting breach risk unintentionally.

**Managerial measures.** Managerial measures are management behaviors and actions aimed at reducing the chance of breach. They are usually coming from an organizational and risk management perspective and encompass security investments, certification and standard compliance, security policies, and executive support. Security investments were shown to lead to lower occurrence of breaches, especially if they are made proactively [\[8\]](#page-12-0), in less digitized organizations

[\[83\]](#page-13-0), and are made substantively and not for symbolic reasons only [\[32\]](#page-13-0). They are commonly used in analytical research, as inputs to aggregate security [\[41\],](#page-13-0) breach probability [\[84\]](#page-13-0), or success against attacks [\[40\]](#page-13-0). Compliance with certain standards or certification schemes was another managerial measure shown to affect the chance of breach, for example, meaningful-use attestation of electronic health records (EHRs) reduced data breaches in hospitals [\[28,29](#page-12-0)]. Stricter security standards by themselves do not necessarily improve firm security but depend on configuration of the not standard-mandated security measures [\[84\]](#page-13-0). The presence of security policies also generally reduces data breach risk as they can keep security incidents from occurring [\[12,15](#page-12-0),[19\]](#page-12-0); in descriptive analyses and case studies, their weakness or lack of enforcement was recognized as a precursor to breaches [[36,42\]](#page-13-0). Executive awareness and support for security measures appears to be instrumental in reducing breaches, although all quantitative evidence found for this stems from two surveys conducted in Korea [[37,38](#page-13-0)]. Using the same data source, a negative association was found between security trainings and data breaches [\[38\].](#page-13-0)

**Technological measures.** Technological measures consist of hardware and software serving security and their management. Organizations' level of security is often operationalized by the number of security technologies used, for example, user authentication, identity management, antivirus programs, encrypted emails, or firewalls [[8](#page-12-0),[28,](#page-12-0)[32,49](#page-13-0)]. Technological measures were also operationalized as access, vulnerability, feature, and traffic controls [\[12\]](#page-12-0). Beyond specific security technologies, systems auditing and logging as well as controlling vulnerabilities and patching software were also shown to play a role in reducing breaches [[12,19\]](#page-12-0). Among specific technologies, we only found dedicated articles on intrusion detection systems (IDS) and encryption. There was no effect of encryption on the loss of medical data [\[39\]](#page-13-0), and IDS benefits were analytically shown to depend on the system's configuration [\[26\]](#page-12-0).

**Information disclosure.** Information disclosure encompasses the sharing of information with third parties or the general public. Threat information sharing among firms has been encouraged by policymakers, for example, by the establishment of organizations such as information sharing and analysis centers (ISACs) to facilitate disclosure of relevant security information. The effect of such information sharing between firms has so far only been shown analytically. In economic models, information sharing has been shown to be more effective in deterring attacks as interdependence and cost of security investment increase [\[40](#page-13-0), [41\]](#page-13-0). Regarding disclosure of vulnerability information, articles studied the impact of full disclosure vs. limited disclosure on breaches. Full disclosure accelerates attack spread, increases attack penetration, and increases the risk of first attacks after a vulnerability has been reported [\[27\]](#page-12-0). Immediately after a previously unknown vulnerability was patched, a spike in attacks was observed, hinting at a race between attackers and defenders [\[85\].](#page-13-0)

Beyond the preventive measures described above, there were also other factors affecting the chance of a breach.

**Human factors.** Human factors are individual behaviors that contribute to a data breach, in contrast to policies, systems, or other organization-level factors. Research on human factors leading to data breaches is distinct from the rest of the literature on antecedents in terms of theoretical perspective and method. Studies researching human factors often were conceptual or descriptive in nature, narratively retelling how certain breaches occurred. These human factors encompass both individuals falling for social engineering attacks, for example, clicking on phishing emails, and human error, for example, carrying unnecessary sensitive information while traveling [\[36,42](#page-13-0)]. Human error was a component of the majority of reported privacy breaches between 2005 and 2008 [\[11\]](#page-12-0). Beyond immediate breach antecedents, IS security research, in general, has focused a lot on human factors, for example, for security policy violation, which itself is an important antecedent of data breaches [\[4,](#page-12-0)[86\]](#page-13-0).

**Management factors.** Management factors are high-level

management decisions that are seemingly unrelated to data breaches but do affect the risk for a data breach. For example, companies with a positive corporate social responsibility (CSR) record in peripheral activities amid high CSR concerns in their core business face an elevated risk of breach [\[33\].](#page-13-0) A number of articles found that mergers & acquisitions activity and divestitures increase the chance of breach [[10,](#page-12-0)[43](#page-13-0)]. These decisions lead to increased organizational and IT complexity, making effective security more difficult [\[43,44](#page-13-0)]. Business partnerships can also lead to an elevated risk of breach, as business partners often have access to each other's data and have interlinked systems [[42,87](#page-13-0)]. This might also be interpreted as increased organizational complexity [\[43\]](#page-13-0). Corporate and IT governance decisions also can influence an organization's risk of data breach. Governance decisions affecting breach risk include the presence of a board-level technology committee [\[46\]](#page-13-0), focusing on IT expertise among executives [\[88\]](#page-13-0), centralization vs. decentralization of IT [\[45\]](#page-13-0), and outsourcing vs. insourcing of the IT function [\[37\]](#page-13-0).

**Organizational attributes.** Organizational attributes are general characteristics of the overall organization that affect the organization's chance of breach. These are often control variables in econometric studies and are seldom the main focus of an article. The most common organizational attribute used is the size of an organization, with larger organizations generally facing more breaches [[13,](#page-12-0)[32\]](#page-13-0). Size also sometimes moderates relationships, for example, the increase in breach risk by EHR implementation [\[29\].](#page-12-0) The risk of data breach varies by industry, however which industries are most and least at risk varies depending on the underlying datasets used [\[47](#page-13-0),[48\]](#page-13-0). Attributes of a company's board, such as the number of directors [\[51\],](#page-13-0) IT director board presence [\[49\]](#page-13-0), and outside engagements of board directors [\[50\]](#page-13-0) are also associated with changes in breach risk.

**Regulatory and auditing factors.** This category encompasses factors related to regulation, enforcement, and auditing that influence the affected organization's chance of breach occurrence. Literature on the effect of data breach notification laws was split, with some articles finding a significant reduction in breaches [\[8,](#page-12-0)[48\]](#page-13-0) but others with different model specification finding either no effect or only a reduction for some breach types [[29,](#page-12-0)[39](#page-13-0)]. Regulatory enforcement actions against cybercriminals in the US are associated with increased attack activity from other countries [\[52\]](#page-13-0). Financial reporting can also provide relevant antecedents to data breaches, as corporations that disclose trade secrets in their 10-k annual reports are facing more breaches than those that do not [\[6\]](#page-12-0). Similarly, corporations' risk disclosure regarding information security risks can be used to predict the corporation's risk of data breach [\[31\]](#page-13-0). Financial audits can also reduce breach risk. The Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) act of 2003 includes mandatory assessments of a corporation's internal controls by auditors. Here, a positive attestation (indicating effective internal controls) is associated with a reduction in breaches [\[54\]](#page-13-0). If auditors perform an integrated IT-financial audit, they can also learn from restatements and audit failures of their clients, leading to a lowered data breach risk for other clients [\[53\]](#page-13-0).

**Technological factors.** Technological factors encompass an organization's use of IT. Notably, these are not the same as the technological measures to prevent data breaches, but rather general hardware and software deployed. Use of more IT equipment and more digitized processes lead to more data breaches [\[13\].](#page-12-0) One instance of this is the adoption of EHRs, which initially leads to an increase in breaches [\[29\]](#page-12-0). Beyond using simply more IT, also a heterogeneous and diverse IT infrastructure with many different applications was shown to increase the chance of breach [\[44\]](#page-13-0). Such heterogeneity also makes IT centralization more effective in preventing breaches [\[45\]](#page-13-0).

### *4.1.2. Consequences*

The eight categories of breach consequences identified in the review were broadly split into internal consequences, affecting the breached organization itself in terms of operations, workforce, legal issues, and finances, and external consequences, affecting the customers,

competitors, suppliers, and other stakeholders.

**Operational consequences.** Operational consequences are those consequences affecting the organization's ability to perform its tasks. This includes a forensic investigation to investigate the origin and extent of the breach [\[55,56](#page-13-0),[63\]](#page-13-0), business disruptions and productivity decreases [[57,58](#page-13-0)], and increased media scrutiny [\[59\]](#page-13-0). Beyond these initial consequences, the loss of business opportunities [\[55\]](#page-13-0) and customer churn [\[61,66](#page-13-0)] can also be observed, as business partners or customers adapt their risk perception of the breached organization. In response to the breach, corporations also decrease their information transparency, as measured by analyst forecast accuracy [\[60\]](#page-13-0).

**Workforce consequences.** These are consequences affecting the staff of the breached organization. Increased media scrutiny and their employer's involvement in the breach might decrease staff morale and retention [[57,59,63](#page-13-0)]. Top managers, especially CIO and CTO, also face a higher risk of dismissal, as they are viewed as responsible for the breach [[10](#page-12-0)[,64](#page-13-0)]. These executive firings are likely symbolic actions from the corporation's perspective, as they do not change the risk of a future breach [\[10\]](#page-12-0).

**Legal consequences.** Legal consequences are consequences following regulations or lawsuits due to a data breach. Regulations require organizations to disclose data breaches affecting third parties' data across different jurisdictions. These notification laws often mandate certain time frames, for example, 30 days in the case of many U.S. states and 72 h in case of the general data protection regulation (GDPR) of the European Union. Organizations thus have an obligation to be able to conduct all activities needed to notify the public about a breach [\[55,59](#page-13-0), [65\]](#page-13-0). If a notification does not occur within the specified timeframe, the organization may face fines [\[59,65](#page-13-0),[66\]](#page-13-0). Notably, notifying the victims whose data were breached in due time is associated with less drastic consequences for firms [[65,74](#page-13-0)]. Irrespective of notification-related fines, organizations might receive fines for their general privacy mishandling. Customers and investors might seek compensation for damages through class-action and liability lawsuits [[55,56,67](#page-13-0)]. If the affected organization hosts data for a third party, service-level agreements might have been violated in the breach, leading to additional fees [\[2\].](#page-12-0)

**Financial consequences.** Financial consequences are all costs that the breached organization is facing because of the breach. The previously described operational, workforce, and legal consequences are inarguably connected to expenditures for the affected organization. These are sometimes visible through reduced sales growth [[63,89\]](#page-13-0), return on assets, return on equity and increased cost of goods sold [[90,91](#page-14-0)], although findings here are conflicting [[89,](#page-13-0)[92](#page-14-0)]. Total data breach costs differ by industry and previous breach exposure [\[47\].](#page-13-0) Some organizations might engage in post-breach remediation activities such as identity protection services and discount offerings [[63](#page-13-0),[66,68\]](#page-13-0). The single most researched consequence of a data breach is its effect on the breached company's stock market value [\[69,70](#page-13-0),[81,](#page-13-0)[90,92](#page-14-0)–97]. Notably, findings are conflicting here, with some studies finding an overall negative significant effect [[93](#page-14-0),[94\]](#page-14-0), and others solely finding an effect of certain types of breaches [\[69](#page-13-0)[,95](#page-14-0)], announcement in certain outlets [\[96\]](#page-14-0) or during certain periods [\[97\]](#page-14-0). The stock market reaction fades in the long term for most studies [\[90,92](#page-14-0),[98\]](#page-14-0), although some find significant negative abnormal returns for up to 250 trading days [\[99\].](#page-14-0) Increased systematic risk arising from data breaches also increases the cost of equity for publicly listed corporations [\[71\]](#page-13-0). Inability to access capital in combination with decreased sales and profits may push some firms to bankruptcy [\[100\]](#page-14-0).

Besides the internal consequences described above, a data breach also carries external consequences for other stakeholders.

**Consequences for customers.** These are consequences that customers of the breached organization are facing. Research focusing on customers has exclusively focused on B2C customers, that is, individual consumers. For customers, hearing of a breach leads to an increased risk perception including concerns about privacy and information sharing

<span id="page-6-0"></span>[[61,62,75](#page-13-0)] and feelings of violation [\[72\]](#page-13-0). Customers worry about time, financial, and material losses occurring to them due to the breach [\[101\]](#page-14-0). In dealing with the breached organization, they decrease their trust and perceptions of reliability and credibility [\[56,73](#page-13-0),[74,](#page-13-0)[102](#page-14-0)]. This might also lead to mass complaints on social media [[103,104\]](#page-14-0). Customers also perceive a decrease in service and information quality [\[75\].](#page-13-0) Accordingly, customers do not only alter their attitudes but also their behaviors after a breach. There is a well-documented decrease in revisit and shopping intentions after a data breach [\[72,76](#page-13-0)[,105,106\]](#page-14-0) and real-world spending data shows that indeed, breached customers reduced their purchases at a retailer [\[9\]](#page-12-0). An increase in channel migration from the breached to non-breached sales channels could also be observed [\[9\]](#page-12-0). Beyond changes in perceived risk, actual risk also is increased for customers, as data breaches can lead to fraudulent credit card charges and identity theft [[56,59\]](#page-13-0).

**Consequences for competitors.** Consequences for competitors are effects the breach can have on companies competing with the breached company. These effects can be both positive or negative, depending on whether stakeholders perceive the event as isolated and firm-specific or relevant to the entire industry [[77](#page-13-0),[89\]](#page-13-0). If the breach is seen as emblematic for the industry, negative spill-over effects can occur, as measured in negative cumulative abnormal stock returns and customer reactions [\[34](#page-13-0),[79,](#page-13-0)[107](#page-14-0)]. Breached firms experience an average stock market impact 1.7 times stronger than their competitors [\[34\]](#page-13-0). If the breach is seen as isolated or firm-specific, customer switching might benefit competitors [\[61\]](#page-13-0). In these cases, positive short-term stock market reactions have been documented for competitors [\[95,108\]](#page-14-0).

**Consequences for supply chain partners.** These are consequences that organizations might face if they are related to the breached company in the form of interconnected systems and planning, such as in a supply chain. Supply chain partners are also perceived to be at risk following a data breach [60–[62\].](#page-13-0) Accordingly, a negative cumulative abnormal stock return has also been documented for supply chain partners of breached companies [\[78](#page-13-0),[79\]](#page-13-0). Supply chain partners also face a decrease in demand, as sales of the breached company's products or services decline [\[56\].](#page-13-0) Due to the overall strain on the relationship between suppliers and the breached company, relationship-specific investments are significantly reduced in the year after the breach and the chance of relationship termination increases [\[80\]](#page-13-0).

**Consequences for other actors.** Beyond customers, competitors and supply chain partners, there are also consequences for other actors. In the case of breached credit card data, fraudulent transactions and card reissuance create costs for merchants, banks and credit card issuers [\[56\]](#page-13-0). If the affected organization purchased cyber insurance, insurers may have to cover part of the cost, which can be a significant amount given the average seven-figure cost of a data breach [\[1,14,](#page-12-0)[47](#page-13-0)]. Consequently, a negative cumulative abnormal return can be observed for insurers with substantial data breach exposures [\[80\]](#page-13-0). Auditors experience higher expenditures and workload after a client's data breach exposure, which increases the cost of auditing and audit fees even for non-breached organizations [[79,80](#page-13-0)], but also helps maintain audit quality after a breach [\[109\].](#page-14-0) Lastly, a publicly announced data breach led to a positive cumulative abnormal return for e-security vendors in the early 2000s [\[81](#page-13-0), [82\]](#page-13-0).

#### *4.2. Theories*

Most of the research on antecedents and consequences of data breaches did not explicitly involve theories; especially event studies and econometric articles focusing on the role of single variables usually reasoned their expected associations without involving theory. However, among those articles that did use theories, noteworthy themes emerged.

#### *4.2.1. Theories used to explain antecedents*

In total, 16 of the 43 articles on antecedents explicitly mentioned

theories, while the other articles mostly used verbal reasoning to argue their proposed relationships, were descriptive, conceptual, analytical, or literature reviews. There were 11 theories employed in the antecedents literature, corresponding to three broad theoretical lenses. An overview of the theories used and their corresponding theoretical lens is provided in Table 2.

The theoretical lens with which data breach antecedents are studied varies considerably. Among the articles employing theories to establish antecedents of breaches, three different lenses emerged: organizational behavior, attacker motivation, and procedural failure. Articles using organizational behavior to study data breach influences mainly employed theories from management or economics to explain organizations' decisions, for example, why hospitals undertake investments [\[32\]](#page-13-0) or why corporations create a technology committee [\[46\].](#page-13-0) In this lens, data breaches thus are a special instance of general business problems and are tackled with theories applied to general business problems. Theories explaining organizational behavior are applied to understand how organizations make decisions and how such decisions affect the risk of a data breach.

The second lens switches the perspective from the potentially breached organizations to the perpetrators and uses theories from criminology. The broad theme here is to understand how changing regulations, cultures [\[48\]](#page-13-0), or organizational routines [\[29\]](#page-12-0) might affect attackers' motivation and targets' attractiveness. In this lens, antecedents arise through an interplay between rational criminals and their would-be victims, and security is improved by becoming a less attractive target. Notably, there was no criminological theory used that did not presume that attackers act rationally. This criminological lens has also been widely used in other information security literature, for example, for policy violation [\[110\].](#page-14-0)

The third lens is the only one focusing on individuals within the breached organization and gives a procedural account of a breach as a failure of organizational systems. For this, Reason's [\[111\]](#page-14-0) theory on human error and the related Swiss cheese model were employed. Compared to both the organizational behavior and attacker theories, this theory is more granular and more concerned with micro-level breach prevention by ensuring appropriate procedures and trainings to prevent multiple security gaps from "lining up" and enabling a breach. The Swiss cheese model follows practitioners' defense-in-depth approaches [\[11\].](#page-12-0) Theories on organizational behavior and attacker motivation were generally used to motivate the causal reasoning or, if applicable, the hypotheses of an article. However, articles employing human error theory generally used it as an overarching framework for case analysis [\[42\]](#page-13-0) or model conceptualization [\[13\],](#page-12-0) and thus relied far heavier on it in their research design.

The lack of one coherent underlying lens and coexistence of these three lenses is symptomatic of data breaches as a complex phenomenon that spans management, technology, and criminology. Some literature seems to be implicitly aware of these three lenses, as both Kim & Kwon [\[29\]](#page-12-0) and Sen & Borle [\[48\]](#page-13-0) combined an organizational with a

|                     | Neo-institutional theory [32,48]                         | Management                |
|                     | Resource-based view of the firm [19]                     | Management                |
|                     | Organizational learning [8,10]                           | Management                |
| Attacker motivation | Routine activity theory [29,83]                          | Criminology               |
|                     | Opportunity theory of crime [48]                         | Criminology               |
|                     | Institutional anomie theory [48]                         | Criminology               |
| Procedural failure  | Human-error theory / Swiss cheese<br>model [11,13,29,42] | Psychology                |

procedural or criminological lens. These three lenses thus are not competing with one another, but rather complement each other.

Notably, after having discovered these three lenses among the articles that used theory, we also noticed them in articles that did not explicitly employ theory for their reasoning. For example, Liu et al. [\[45\]](#page-13-0)  employed an organizational behavior lens, arguing for security benefits from economies of scale and general organizational behavior, and Ettredge et al. [\[6\]](#page-12-0) implicitly used a criminological lens, arguing that trade secret disclosure makes companies more attractive targets. When we coded all articles on antecedents for appearance of any of these lenses, irrespective of actual theory use, we found that 22 articles employed an organizational behavior lens, 11 used an attacker motivation lens, and 7 a procedural one. Out of those, 5 articles used more than one lens. A special case of an implicit organizational behavior and procedural lens is provided by Khan et al. [\[14\],](#page-12-0) who apply risk management models to study the literature on data breaches. 9 articles did not use any specific lens, these were mostly articles that used modeling or descriptive statistics. Except for 3 of 4 articles with a solely procedural lens focusing on human factors towards a breach, there was no noticeable trend or clustering between theoretical lenses and concepts.

Overall, the lenses uncovered in the literature show the diversity of perspectives by which data breach occurrence can be explained. Understanding what leads to a data breach involves understanding how organizations make security-relevant business decisions, how attackers choose their targets, and how systems of people and procedures fail at maintaining security. The dominance of the organizational behavior and attacker motivation lenses is striking, and more research could explicitly consider the process of how a compromise happens. An in-depth understanding of a data breach needs to account for all three lenses, as can be seen in Ransbotham & Mitra's model of the information security compromise process [\[12\]](#page-12-0), which was the only article to employ all three, and also the only article to attempt to give an overarching account of how incidents happen.

### *4.2.2. Theories used to explain consequences*

In the literature on consequences, 21 articles used theories. Among these 21 articles, 19 different theories were employed. An overview of the theories used in the consequences literature is provided in Table 3.

Given that the literature on data breach consequences covers more stakeholders than the one on antecedents, unsurprisingly, there is also greater diversity among the theories used. Generally, the theories and overarching lenses can be differentiated between those that explain relationships on organizational and individual levels. These levels describe the unit of analysis the theory operates on, which is not necessarily equal to the methodological unit of analysis of the article.

Among the organizational theories, a distinct group emerges that views a data breach as an instance of a general organizational crisis. These articles employed theories from wider crisis management literature, such as the service failure and recovery perspectives from marketing [\[72\],](#page-13-0) situational crisis communication theory from communication studies [\[104\]](#page-14-0) or the theory of psychological contract breach from management [\[72\].](#page-13-0) From this perspective, a data breach is a crisis that needs to be managed by the organization. These theories are generally focused on how trust towards the organization from its stakeholders is lost or regained. In the research on data breach consequences, it is mostly concerned with the relationship outcomes between a breached company and its customers.

Although the majority of organization-focused theories used the crisis lens, other theories were also employed. There was no notable shared lens among those other theories; they were used to explain differences in stock market reactions to data breaches across countries [\[114\]](#page-14-0) or within an industry [\[77\]](#page-13-0) or saw the data breach as evidence of a resource weakness [\[115\]](#page-14-0). Efficiency theory and Institutional theory were used to explain changes in the audit committee after a breach [\[116\].](#page-14-0) Environmental scanning was used to explain executive behavior in managing a breach [\[100\].](#page-14-0)

Among the individual-level theories, two articles employed theories developed specifically around information privacy. These theories, gossip theory [\[34\]](#page-13-0) and information boundary theory [\[117\]](#page-14-0), are concerned with people's reactions to either unsanctioned information collection and use, or attempts to cross their information space. Notably, both these theories do not stem from management or economics, but rather from psychology and information studies. Although they, similar to the crisis-lens theories, are concerned with the relation between an organization and their breached stakeholders, the perspective here is switched, from an organization interested in remediation, to an individual being violated. The second individual-level lens was concerned with explaining individuals' perception of and reaction to the data breach. These theories were used to explain stronger reactions of people who opened a notification email [\[9\]](#page-12-0) or how emotional distress affects responsibility judgment after a breach [\[118\]](#page-14-0).

The overall picture of the theories employed in the consequences literature is more heterogeneous than in the antecedents literature. Similar to the antecedents, some articles apply multiple theories within a lens [\[72\]](#page-13-0) or theories across lenses [\[9\].](#page-12-0)

When searching the entirety of the reviewed consequences articles for the presence of the aforementioned lenses, irrespectively of whether they appeared explicitly through theories or implicitly in the causal reasoning and hypothesis development, we found that 14 articles viewed a data breach as an organizational crisis, and 11 articles had a different, non-crisis organizational perspective on data breaches. For example, these studies argued that organizational characteristics affect breach impacts [e.g., 59] or used reasoning from the accounting literature on why a data breach might lead to CEO and CIO firings [\[64\]](#page-13-0). From the individual-level lenses, 4 articles used a privacy-centered lens and 8 focused on individual perception differences after a breach. A majority of the consequences literature, 46 articles, did not use any theoretical lens. 33 of those were econometric studies and event studies focusing on stock market and financial impacts on the breached <span id="page-8-0"></span>company and competitors.3 These studies generally based their reasoning on negative information affecting future cash flows and mixed results of prior studies. There was some amount of clustering between theoretical lenses and concepts: all articles that used an individual perception lens used this to study consequences on customers, and nearly all articles viewing the data breach as an organizational crisis or as a privacy violation were either concerned with consequences on customers or financial consequences on the firm. Other organizational perspectives were, however, widely spread across the concepts.

Overall, a dichotomy emerges between organization-centric and individual-centric theoretical lenses. This dichotomy is similar to the broad categorization of concepts identified above ([Section 4.1\)](#page-3-0) being split between consequences on the affected firm and consequences on other stakeholders, although it does not align perfectly with it. Understanding the consequences of a data breach requires an understanding of why and how different stakeholders are affected, which can be seen in both the concepts and theoretical lenses. Here it is notable that there was a relative dearth of individual-level, and especially privacy-focused theories being used.

### *4.3. Methods*

Research on the antecedents and consequence of data breaches has employed a multitude of methods. Empirical-quantitative research is dominant in both areas, with applied econometrics the most commonly employed method for studying antecedents and event studies the most common method for studying consequences Table 4. provides an overview of the methods used.

Nonempirical research comprised 9 of 43 articles among the antecedents. Most of these created analytical models, both from a gametheoretic perspective [[26](#page-12-0)[,41](#page-13-0)] and from an operations modeling perspective [\[87\].](#page-13-0) In contrast, analytical models were almost entirely absent from the literature on consequences, besides two articles on breach impact on business processes [\[58\]](#page-13-0) and supply chains [\[78\]](#page-13-0). Literature reviews, however, were a lot more common in the research on consequences. This increased consolidation can be seen as a sign of more research activity on breach consequences compared to antecedents and is in line with the higher number of articles found in our review of the consequences and the stronger growth there (see [Fig. 3\)](#page-3-0). All seven literature review papers also were published between 2016 and 2021,

indicating a recent rise in maturity in the field.

Qualitative approaches were extremely rare. These were used to study how companies attempt to prevent and respond to data breaches [\[15\]](#page-12-0), how consumers perceive and react to them [[101](#page-14-0),[120\]](#page-14-0), and how class action lawsuits in response to them develop [\[67\].](#page-13-0) Mixed-methods research identified was highly diverse, ranging from modeling combined with applied econometrics [\[27\]](#page-12-0) to multiple quantitative methods used to investigate different aspects of data breach consequences [\[34\]](#page-13-0). By far the most common methodological approach was quantitative research. Here, applied econometrics and event studies were used most commonly.

An overview of the methods and corresponding units of analysis can be seen in Table 5 and [Table 6.](#page-9-0) Among the literature on antecedents, nearly all articles analyzed the breached organization. This held true across nearly all methods. Conceptual and descriptive articles used the breaches themselves as unit of analysis to make statements about, for example, breach cost [\[47\]](#page-13-0) or human errors [\[42\].](#page-13-0) Various articles used other units of analysis, such as enforcement actions [\[52\]](#page-13-0) or vulnerabilities [\[85\]](#page-13-0). In the consequences literature, a split across methods and units of analysis was noticeable. Every single article employing surveys or experiments4 analyzed the individual. Regarding the main focus in terms of concepts (see [Section 4.1](#page-3-0)), all of the articles employing an individual unit of analysis were focused on consequences for customers. Beyond this, there was no discernible pattern of associations between methods and covered concepts. Similar to antecedents, there were various units of analysis used only once in the literature on consequences, for example, breaches [\[47\]](#page-13-0) and tweets [\[104\]](#page-14-0).

Overall, although there is considerable methodological diversity in the study of data breaches' antecedents and consequences, research analyzing organizations, applying econometrics and event studies, clearly dominates. In part, this seems to be driven by limitations to studying data breaches as an organization-level phenomenon that does not allow for experimentation for legal and ethical reasons. However, more research, especially qualitative, might allow researchers to gain an even deeper understanding of the antecedents of data breaches and what specific policy choices and internal behaviors caused a breach. Similarly, interviews or focus groups might allow better insight into companies' decision processes after a breach occurrence and customers' reasoning and thoughts after their data has been breached.

### *4.4. Data*

A variety of data sources was used in the literature on data breaches.

Not all methods made use of data sets of multiple breach incidents; case studies usually focused on one or a few breach instances (e.g., [[15,](#page-12-0)[121](#page-14-0)]) and surveys and survey experiments sampled data sets on the individual level rather than the breach level. It was noteworthy that among research at the individual unit of analysis, not a single study used more than three different data breaches in their study design. Out of the 17 studies analyzing individuals, 10 used hypothetical scenario-based settings, asking respondents to imagine a breach had happened, whereas four studies used one to three real-world breaches as their setting. In the literature on antecedents, 30 of the 43 articles used data sets on the breach-level; of these 30, 2 used only data of self-collected breach incidents, whereas the other 28 relied on a pre-existing breach data source. For the literature on consequences, 50 of the 83 used data sets on breach level, of which 17 self-collected their data and 33 used archival sources. This larger number of self-collected data is mainly driven by early event studies that often identified their data breach events by searching through LexisNexis, ProQuest, search engines, and newspaper archives (e.g., [[69,](#page-13-0)[93,94](#page-14-0)]).

An overview of the pre-existing breach datasets identified in the literature is given in Table 7. Note that the sum of data sources being

used does not sum up to the number of articles mentioned above, as many studies combined multiple of these data sources.

The data source used most often is the dataset by Privacy Rights Clearinghouse (PRC),5 a non-profit organization advocating privacy rights. After its latest January 2020 update, it included 9015 breaches categorized by 8 types and 8 industries since 2005. PRC collects the breach data from breach notifications and media reporting. Although the PRC dataset is comprehensive, the manner in which its data are collected means it is not necessarily representative, for example, states whose attorneys general publish breaches on their websites, such as Vermont, are oversampled.

The second most common data sources in the literature were those provided by the Open Security Foundation, that is, DataLossDB and Cloutage. However, the Open Security Foundation is now defunct and its datasets are unavailable on the public web. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)6 publishes all breaches of unsecured health information affecting 500 or more individuals on their website, together with the type of breach and the location of the breached information. The resulting dataset has been used mostly by researchers studying the antecedents of breaches in the healthcare context and has the benefit that it can be assumed to be mostly complete and representative, as the disclosure happens directly by the body the breaches have to be reported to. The Identity Theft Resource Center (ITRC), another non-profit organization specialized in helping victims of identity theft7 also creates annual reports of data breaches that are combined into a database available by subscription, including over 12,250 data breaches. AuditAnalytics, a data provider company also offers a subscription-based dataset of cybersecurity breaches of SEC reporting entities, together with disclosure and discovery information. Both the ITRC and AuditAnalytics data sets were used three times in the literature.

Many data sets or reports were only used once or twice in studies of data breach antecedents or consequences so far. Many of these refer to single reports used (e.g., the Big Brother Watch annual report used for [\[42\]](#page-13-0)) or are outdated (e.g., Attrition, a website collecting information on data breaches from 2000 to 2008 later integrated into DataLossDB). Some data sets likely were not much used because of their special content, for example, the VERIS Community Database (VCDB) contains detailed technical incident information directly entered by security professionals working on these incidents; however, its popularity has decreased since 2012 and it only includes relatively few entries after that.

A general problem regarding the quality of these data sets is that most of them are not a truly random sample or overall population of data breaches.8 For some industries, for example, healthcare, the HHS database approximates this, but there is not central entity capturing and disclosing data breach information across industries. Most breach data is also heavily skewed towards or exclusively contains U.S. incidents. For instance, the PRC and HHS databases contain exclusively breaches of U. S. organizations. Perhaps the closest approximation to a representative data source is the cyber insurance claim data set presented by Romanosky [\[47\].](#page-13-0) Interestingly, this dataset features some information regarding damages and attack rates different from the scientific literature based on the above data sources or industry reports such as those of the Ponemon Institute.

## **5. Future implications**

Based on the insights from the results section, a number of implications for future research emerge. The future implications are structured

<span id="page-10-0"></span>alongside the results chapter, that is, insights based on the concepts, theories, methods, and data. A short overview of the future implications is provided in Table 8.

### *5.1. Implications from concepts*

Based on the concepts developed in the literature and the topics covered (see [Section 4.1](#page-3-0) ), we find four implications for future research. First, the large number of studies on the stock market impact of a data breach and their conflicting results across different time frames and samples calls for a meta-analysis on the topic. Following the Cochrane terminology, such a meta-analysis could statistically compare the effect sizes measured, explain differences across studies, and calculate a summary effect size [\[122\]](#page-14-0). As meta-analyses in social science are often hampered by large differences in study designs, constructs, and variables, this plethora of highly similar studies provides a rare opportunity to generalize from a large number of comparable, individual studies.

Second, research can integrate the antecedents and consequences to construct a nomological network of data breaches. Considering the separate coding of both reviews, the similarity of many of the identified categories is striking. Potentially testable questions that emerge from this review include:

• Do some of the regulatory factors identified as breach antecedents affect the lawsuits and fees after breaches? Do highly publicized data breach fees encourage companies to invest in security measures and prevent future breaches?

- Are the positive effects of auditors on data breach prevention related to the increased audit cost and fees after a breach? Is there a positive feedback loop in auditors' involvement?
- Do different amounts and degrees of security investments lead to different financial consequences? Do upfront investments not only reduce the chance of breach, but also the costs arising through breaches?
- Do different management actions before the breach lead to different operational consequences, for example, is higher executive awareness ex ante related to fewer operational disturbances and costs after the breach?

Third, there are drastic differences in the certainty with which some causal relationships are established. At one end of this spectrum are real or quasi-experiments [\[9,](#page-12-0)[123](#page-14-0)] showing actual differences in people's behavior after being breached or hearing of a breach. At the other end are scenario-based surveys or reviews including practitioner reports. For example, bankruptcy as a breach consequence [\[100\]](#page-14-0) is solely based on practitioners reports and business disruptions are usually described verbally and seldom the main focus of an article's quantitative analysis. Occasionally, disruptions are measured by firm performance indicators [[91,124\]](#page-14-0). Increased media scrutiny has found its way into academic literature based on risk management practice [\[59\]](#page-13-0). Loss of employee morale has been conceptualized [\[63\]](#page-13-0) and measured in an adapted business crime survey [\[57\]](#page-13-0). Lack of operationalization and measurement of these concepts as part of research articles does not invalidate them; especially if the concept stems from practitioner reports, it is very likely a real phenomenon. However, it reveals a superficial and vague understanding of these concepts among academics. Especially research into breach consequences that are not easily measurable in standard databases (i.e., go beyond financial data) is facing this issue. Accordingly, the breach consequences mentioned above (bankruptcy, media scrutiny, employee morale) should be measured more rigorously quantitatively or investigated in greater depth qualitatively.

A special case of the above issue is present in the antecedents literature. Although executive awareness has been widely reported to be a relevant factor in preventing data breaches among practitioners, the only empirical evidence for this stems from two South Korean surveys [[37,38](#page-13-0)]. This calls for more evidence from outside South Korea, to better understand if and how executive awareness impacts breach risk.

Fourth, there are some curious gaps among the concepts identified. On some topics, we expected literature to exist but did not find any. For example, there is scarce literature on real effects of breaches on the individuals whose records were breached. Extant literature on data breaches has mostly focused on risk perceptions and reactions towards the breached organization keeping the individuals' data. Few articles mention cases of identity theft, but we did not find any study attempting to quantify real damages to individuals from data breaches. How common is identity theft? How many of these cases consist of few fraudulent credit card charges and reissuances vis-a-vis ` extended cases of identity theft spanning weeks or months? Do breached email addresses receive more spam? These are all research questions that are fundamental to understanding the effects of data breaches on consumers, yet appear to be unanswered. Similarly, what happens to breached datasets and how long the consequences of a data breach persist was not studied in the literature we reviewed. Research focusing on effects on customers exclusively considered B2C companies, that is, consumers as customers, and ignored the effect of breaches in B2B relationships. Lastly, while accounting is the second-largest discipline publishing data breach research (see [Figs. 2](#page-3-0) and [3\)](#page-3-0) and accountants have published on the relationship of data breaches and banking loan terms, audit committees, and CIO turnover, there was no article found on disclosure effects of a data breach. Especially in light of the non-accounting findings on decreased information transparency [\[60\],](#page-13-0) this appears to be a promising research topic.

### *5.2. Implications from the theoretical lenses*

A number of implications follow from the theoretical lenses discovered. First, it is notable that although there is a criminological lens focusing on breach perpetrators among the antecedents, there is no equivalent to this in the consequences. Perhaps criminological literature on crime victims could provide a relevant new perspective when studying individuals whose data was lost in a data breach. Similarly, theories on white-collar crime and fraud could provide relevant background for organizational consequences of data breaches. For organizations, more procedural theories, similar to the Swiss cheese model [\[42\]](#page-13-0) and the information security compromise process [\[12\]](#page-12-0), could add a time dimension to the handling and consequences of a data breach. For this, researchers could also employ parallel process models to simultaneously explain both positive and negative behaviors leading to or helping prevent a breach; such models have been successfully used to study security policy compliance [\[125\]](#page-14-0).

Second, the difference between the organizational crisis lens and the individual privacy lens in the literature on consequences is noteworthy. These two perspectives, informed by different originating disciplines, are complementary viewpoints on the effect of a data breach on individuals. The organizational crisis lens views a data breach as a crisis to be managed by a company, whereas the privacy lens focuses on private information and responses to its unintended disclosure, thus arguing from the perspective of an individual whose privacy was violated. The former is found in the literature far more often than the latter. Research limited to crisis-recovery lenses might miss relevant perceptions of customers regarding their own data and privacy. Thus, even organization research might benefit from adopting a privacy-oriented lens. In addition, more focus could be directed at first-order perceptual reactions of breach victims. Currently most individual-level research focuses on crisis management and relationship outcomes towards the breached organization.

### *5.3. Implications from the methods*

Regarding the methods, the abundance of quantitative and relative absence of qualitative research is noteworthy. Although a large amount of established quantitative research is an indication of maturity in data breach research, this conflicts with the lack of deep understanding of many breach consequences mentioned in [Section 5.1.](#page-10-0) Case study research regarding bankruptcy, media scrutiny, and workforce consequences after a data breach could help researchers better understand these phenomena. The same holds true for research into executive awareness and real effects of a data breach on the customers whose data was breached.

### *5.4. Implications from the data sources*

Prior research almost exclusively employed binary breach variables (breach vs. no breach), without accounting for the different severity or emergence of data breaches. This gap has been recognized in the literature [\[57\],](#page-13-0) and one recent article explicitly sampled severe data breaches only [\[71\].](#page-13-0) Most studies employ standard breach databases and use breach occurrence or non-occurrence as dependent or independent variables; there is no differentiation made between a stolen laptop leading to the loss of 50 customer files and a hack of 50 million credit card numbers. As differences in severity have been identified as playing a role in customer reactions [\[76\],](#page-13-0) future studies could include multiple alternative breach specifications to capture such differences. Moving away from binary, one-size-fits-all operationalization of data breaches could yield new insights. Some scarcely-used data sources, such as the VERIS Community Data Base with many breach attributes could also be helpful here.

This issue is especially pressing for research into consequences for customers. In the future, this research stream could employ more diverse breach specifications, use real-world breaches and contrast different kinds of breaches to improve its validity. Research at the individual unit of analysis (which mostly covers customer consequences) overwhelmingly uses only a single hypothetical breach scenario in its study design. Beyond the weakness of scenario-based studies in general, with only a single data breach scenario it is unclear to which extent the measured consequences may be due to idiosyncrasies of the company and breach description. This could be alleviated by employing a variety of breach scenarios, or ideally, surveying victims of different real-world data breaches.

Most organizational research employed standard databases that often provide skewed samples of data breaches occurring in the U.S. This inevitably limits the generalizations that can be drawn from previous results. This is especially relevant since different jurisdictions have vastly different data protection regimes, yet so far there is almost no insight from outside the United States. Future research could attempt to investigate more international samples, for example, by using datasets generated by E.U. data security officers since passage of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). By doing this, it could be investigated whether the effects observed so far hold true in general or are idiosyncratic to the U.S.

### **6. Discussion and conclusion**

Our review of 43 articles on antecedents of data breaches and 83 articles on their consequences allowed us to provide an overview of the concepts discussed in the literature, the theoretical lenses adopted, and the methods and data sets used. We provide a number of implications for future research, point out methodological weaknesses, and propose relevant future research questions and foci.

Through this, we make three major contributions to the information security literature. First, we synthesize the scattered literature on what influences a data breach and what follows from it. This literature previously was scattered across fields and journals and most articles we found did not have a complete overview of even their specific category (see 4.1) of data breach antecedents and consequences. To our best knowledge, we are the first to thoroughly review and structure this literature. Although some reviews exist on specific facets of breach consequences (e.g., economic impacts [\[63\]](#page-13-0) or stock market reactions [\[70\]](#page-13-0)), no single article structured consequences across units of analysis and disciplines. A recent article on data breach risk management covered steps organizations can take to prevent breaches that overlap with some preventive measures identified here [\[14\]](#page-12-0). Beyond this, we are not aware of any article focused on reviewing breach antecedents. Similarly, no article so far has been concerned with theory use in data breach research. With this review, researchers obtain an overview of the literature on data breaches across disciplines.

Second, through our review we establish which topics are studied a lot (e.g., financial consequences of breaches, customer reactions towards a breached company) and which topics are relatively understudied (effects on breached individuals that do not relate to the breached company, the role of disclosure in breach prevention, human factors leading to a breach). By providing this overview, we inform researchers of which topics are more saturated and which topics provide fruitful avenues for future research. Similarly, we provide an overview of the previous methods used in data breach research. The combination of understudied topics and underused methods can be used to fill gaps in prior research (see [Section 5](#page-9-0)). This can also be used to help integrate data breach research with wider information security research. For example, routine activity theory has been used to explain employee computer abuse [\[110\],](#page-14-0) but also is used within a criminological lens on data breach antecedents. Similarly, this review found a relationship between security policy compliance and data breach occurrence [[36,42\]](#page-13-0). Considering the large importance that research into information security policy compliance has in IS research [\[4](#page-12-0)[,86](#page-13-0)[,125\]](#page-14-0), this finding supports the relevance of the policy compliance literature. Establishing that security

<span id="page-12-0"></span>compliance matters in preventing breaches can help motivate the further study of it.

Third, we uncover the theoretical lenses that researchers use to analyze data breaches. The trichotomy between an organizational, a criminological, and a procedural lens for breach antecedents can aid researchers in trying to uncover root causes of data breaches, which is an important focus area of future research identified in a recent review [4]. The different lenses of consequences are also indicative of two different perspectives of what a data breach fundamentally is. The organizational crisis lens views a data breach as a special instance of more general organizational crises and thus employs theories that could also be used to understand bad service provision, environmental disasters, and CSR failures. In contrast, the privacy lens views a data breach as a uniquely new phenomenon centered around the violation of individuals' privacy. These two viewpoints have coexisted in previous data breach research (although the former has dominated) and the present literature review has made them salient. Through this, more individual-level research with a privacy-centered theoretical lens could emerge, which would help expand data breach research beyond what is currently known. The relative lack of privacy-centered research might also be why certain topics (e.g., real effects on breach victims) have received limited attention so far.

Despite its contributions, the review also has limitations. First, despite our comprehensive search terms, it is of course possible that some important articles and concepts were missed. This is unlikely, especially for impactful articles that were cited a lot, but cannot be ruled out completely. Working papers and pre-prints were not searched, as they are not peer-reviewed, and thus research concepts that are just emerging might be missed. Second, reviewed articles used various terms for data breaches, such as security incidents or cyber-attack, without always explicitly defining these terms. Thus, their working definitions did not necessarily line up with ours and it is possible that some inconsistencies happened regarding article inclusion. Third, this review should not be taken as an overview of all the antecedents and consequences of data breaches existing in the real world; it merely reflects the state of the business research, information systems, and applied computer science literature.

We created a systematic review answering research questions on what antecedents and consequences of data breaches exist in the literature, what theories, methods, and data sources were used, and how future research could move forward. This review helps authors and practitioners in figuring out the structure of extant research, assessing the methodological and theoretical state of the field, and engaging in future research.
