## Abstract 

Prior research finds that internal control material weakness (ICMW) reduces the reliability of financial reporting num-bers, imposes costs on firms and affects firm performance. Given these effects, we examine two research questions: Does the disclosure of ICMW hamper a firm’s ability to hire high-ability CEOs? Consequentially, does it also impact CEO contracting in terms of the compensation offered to newly hired CEOs? We provide three key findings. First, we find firms that disclose ICMW are more likely to appoint CEOs with lower managerial ability relative to firms that do not disclose ICMW. Second, we find ICMW firms offer lower compensation to new CEOs, suggesting that the pay offered is commensurate with the ability of the CEO recruited. However, the negative relation between ICMW and com-pensation is attenuated for individual CEOs with relatively higher abilities. Further analyses reveal that some high-ability CEOs do take positions at ICMW firms, but these ICMW firms pay a premium to hire them, which contributes to greater dispersion and disparity in pay among the top-five executives. Overall, our results point to ICMW imposing labor market consequences in terms of firm recruitment of high-ability CEOs.

## 1 INTRODUCTION 

The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) is considered the“most influential employee in large modern companies” (Balsmeier et al., 2013). Hence, the recruitment of a CEO, which entails both her appointment and contracting, is considered one of the important tasks of a firm’s board of directors. This paper examines whether the disclosure of internal control material weakness (ICMW) has a bearing on a firm’ ability to hire a high-quality CEO to lead the organization and its resulting implication on CEO compensation. Two contemporary streams of research motivate our inquiry. The first line of inquiry relates to ICMW, which is posited to increase the “possibility that a material misstatement of the company’s annual or interim financial state-ments will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis’’ (PCAOB, 2007). Prior research on ICMW suggests that it engenders a broad range of effects, detrimental to the performance and value of the firm involved. 1 The second line of inquiry germane to our investigation is the research on managerial ability. Managers such as a firm’s CEO are vested with the decision rights in relation to matters such as firm financing, operations and investments, and the results of these decisions may vary across managers because of variation in managerial ability. For example, Demerjian et al. (2012) find that replacing CEOs with more able CEOs improves subsequent firm performance. While this evidence speaks to the impact of highly able CEOs, recruiting them is not an easy task since they represent a scarce resource, and there is an intense competition to recruit highly able CEOs (e.g., Jung & Subramaniam, 2017). Taken together, the above lines of inquiry suggest that a firm’s success is dependent on its ability to recruit high-quality managers and that a firm’s performance can be impeded if a firm experiences ICMW. 2 Given the adverse effect of ICMW on a firm’s performance, it raises a question of whether the disclosure of ICMW will impede a firm’s ability to recruit high-ability managers. The argument here is that potential CEO candidates will construe ICMW as a gov-ernance failure and recognize the potential adverse effects of ICMW on a firm’s expected future performance and hence may be reluctant to accept an offer. This is also likely if managers perceive ICMW as a red flag indicative of deeper problems within the firm such as a problematic corporate culture. Prior research on corporate executives finds that individuals seek to safeguard their own reputations and avoid professional penalties by seeking job opportunities before their firms become troubled (e.g., Boivie et al., 2012; Gales & Kesner, 1994; Semadeni et al., 2008). Hence, highly able managers, who are more likely to attract financially strong employers willing to pay high wages, may resist work-ing for ICMW firms. 3 We examine whether firms that announce ICMW find it difficult to recruit high-ability CEOs, compared to firms not disclosing ICMW. 4Besides its impact on the hiring decision, we also examine the impact of ICMW on the employment-related con-tracting between the newly appointed CEO and the firm. In recruiting a CEO, a firm has to determine the level of compensation to be paid to the new CEO. There are multiple theoretical views that offer guidance on whether ICMW will have a bearing on the compensation of a new CEO. One view is that the firm will pay compensation that is com-mensurate with the new CEO’s ability. To the extent that ICMW hinders the firm’s ability to hire high-ability CEOs, then ICMW is anticipated to be associated with lower CEO compensation. A second view is that ICMW firms will face greater demand for higher compensation by CEOs. As noted above, ICMW can affect a firm’s performance and hence have an adverse impact on the value of a CEO’s human capital. Since a CEO is “unable to fully insure her human capital 1 ICMW reduces the reliability of financial statements (Ashbaugh-Skaife et al., 2008; Doyle et al., 2007b; Ghosh & Lee 2013) and imposes other adverse consequences such as a higher cost of capital (Ashbaugh-Skaife et al., 2009; Dhaliwal et al., 2012; Kim et al., 2011; Lai, 2019) and inefficient investments (M. Cheng et al., 2013). As such, announcements of ICMW induce negative stock market reaction about the firm value (Hammersley et al., 2008). 2 Technically, the new CEO could be an external hire or an internally promoted candidate. While outside candiddates are more likely to “screen” firms looking for a CEO, internal promotion candidates are already at that particular firm and would likely be more willing to assume the CEO role, despite ICMW issues. 3 We acknowledge that some capable CEOs may be willing to take job offers from troubled companies that are willing to pay high compensation. However, on average, highly able CEOs with multiple competitive job offers with comparable wages would prefer an organization with a strong internal control environ-ment rather than risk-taking at a troubled firm (Bertrand & Mullainathan 2003). 4 While this prediction is plausible, it is possible that our prediction may not be borne out empirically. The reason is that all managers have a price and hence highly able managers can be attracted by offering them a generous compensation package. If the above argument holds, then it would work against finding evidence supporting our prediction. 14685957, 2021, 9-10, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jbfa.12560 by Aalto University, Wiley Online Library on [31/07/2025].

risk,” she may demand a higher level of compensation that accounts for this risk (Chemmanur et al., 2013, also see, e.g., Berk et al., 2010; Berkovitch et al., 2000; Rose, 1992). A final view suggests that ICMW may have little or no impact on CEO compensation. Principally, it is argued that firms will distort CEO compensation in that they will offer higher compensation to their CEO with the goal of influencing market perceptions (and boosting short-term prices) about the ability of the CEO. As such, the relation between ICMW and new CEO compensation remains an empirical question. In assessing this relation, we recognize that managerial ability is not a factor that is dichotomous but rather can take on a range of values. Hence, the board may take note of this finer distinction in the CEO’s ability in formulating their compensation. The implication here is that higher quality managers may be able to demand higher compensation and, in part, offset or enhance the effects due to ICMW on incoming CEO compensation. To shed further light on the impact of ICMW on new CEO ability and compensation, we examine whether ICMW also has a bearing on the relative importance of the CEO among the top-five executive team (Bebchuk et al., 2011). If ICMW, on average, adversely affects a firm’s ability to attract higher-ability managers and the firm pays the com-pensation that is commensurate with CEO ability, then ICMW will lower pay disparity and dispersion among the top executives of the firm. In contrast, if ICMW results in the new CEO demanding a higher compensation amount, then the incoming CEO compensation will in fact create greater pay disparity and greater pay dispersion among executives. To the extent that finer distinctions in CEO ability matter, we expect the relation of ICMW with pay disparity and pay dispersion to vary with the level of ability of the incoming CEO. To test our predictions, we use a sample of CEO appointments during the years between 2005 and 2016. 5 Consis-tent with prior studies (e.g., Feng et al., 2009; Kim et al., 2011), a firm is deemed to have an ICMW in a particular fiscal year if the auditor concludes in the Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) 404 report filed with the Securities and Exchange Com-mission (SEC) that the firm’s internal control is ineffective. To measure managerial ability, we follow the approach of Demerjian et al. (2012), who use data envelopment analysis (DEA) to obtain the measure of firm efficiency (i.e., the ability to generate more revenues from a given set of inputs), and then compute managerial ability as the residual obtained by regressing the firm efficiency measure on its determinants and firm fixed effects. Demerjian et al. (2012) show that the managerial ability measure they derive contains the manager-specific component, exhibits significant association with manager fixed effects and outperforms other measures of ability such as media attention. 6 As a vali-dation test of the CEO ability measure, we compare the 3-day announcement returns to CEO appointments for more able CEOs with those for less able CEOs. We find that the difference in the announcement returns is positive and significant, suggesting that the CEO ability measure has a manager-specific element that is valued by the market. Sim-ilar to prior research on CEO compensation, we use total annual compensation, which is the sum of salary, bonus and equity-based compensation. Moreover, pay disparity and pay dispersion are computed using the total compensation of five executives including the new CEO. Our identification strategy exploits new CEO appointments, which offer an ideal setting for our analysis. Chang et al. (2016, p.1634) view new CEO appointments as “especially informative because the process of selection and recruitment is likely to assign significant weight to managerial attributes that are observable to the recruiter but not to the researcher.” As such, the focus on new CEOs makes the omitted variable problem less of an econometric con-cern in our analysis because the new CEO’s compensation is determined before they are appointed as the CEO of the 5 Section 404(b) of the 2002 SOX Act requires each registered public accounting firm that prepares or issues the audit report for the issuer to assess internal controls. This requirement first became effective for firms with fiscal years ending after November 15, 2004. Consistent with Feng et al. (2009), we use auditor’s opinion (adverse or clean) to identify ICMW. We do not include firms that disclose material weaknesses under Section 302 because prior research (e.g., Feng et al. 2009, p. 193) note that “the disclosure rules under Section 302 are more ambiguous (see Ashbaugh-Skaife et al., 2007) and require a less rigorous assessment of internal controls.” Hsu and Liao (2012, p.1241) also notes that “The SOX 404 opinion issued from an independent auditor provides a reliable certification of the effectiveness of a firm’s internal control.” 6 An advantage of using the widely available financial information of a firm to construct Demerjian et al.’s (2012) CEO ability measure is that it does not require individual level data such as CEO characteristics. Another advantage is that it isolates factors affecting firm efficiency, thereby mitigating the concern that our results may capture the adverse effects of ICMW on firm performance. Demerjian et al.’s measure has been extensively used as a proxy for CEO ability in various contexts of prior studies (see, e.g., Andreou et al., 2016; W. Choi et al., 2015; De Franco et al., 2017; Demerjian et al. 2013; Koester et al., 2017). 14685957, 2021, 9-10, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jbfa.12560 by Aalto University, Wiley Online Library on [31/07/2025].

firm. By comparing variables (e.g., compensation) relating to new CEOs at firms with and without ICMW disclosure, our identification strategy allows us to better isolate the effect of ICMW announcements on CEO recruitments. We find that firms that disclose ICMW are more likely to hire new CEOs with lower managerial ability relative to firms that do not disclose ICMW. While this evidence indicates that ICMW disclosure impairs a firm’s ability to recruit highly able CEOs, we also find that some high-ability CEOs do take positions at ICMW firms, but these ICMW firms pay a premium to hire them, which contributes to greater dispersion and disparity in pay among the top-five executives. Moreover, we find that ICMW is associated with lower compensation for the incoming CEO. These results are robust to the use of entropy balancing to create a control sample of firms that exhibit covariate balance with the ICMW sample of firms. We also conduct a battery of robustness tests to rule out alternative explanations. First, we provide evidence that our findings are robust to the exclusion of interim CEO appointments. Second, our results hold when we remove CEO appointments during fiscal years that overlap the financial crisis period. Third, our findings are robust when we keep the first CEO appointment observation for each firm in our sample period. Finally, the inferences hold when we use a matched sample of CEO appointments from the same industry and with the same reasons for CEO departures. Overall, our results indicate that ICMW limits the firm’s ability to recruit highly able CEOs and that compensation for new CEOs is commensurate with the level of CEO ability. We acknowledge that CEO labor market outcomes reflect demand- and supply-side forces, namely, a prospective CEO candidate’s decision to supply labor and a firm’s decision to demand CEO skills. Nevertheless, our results reported in the study are consistent with a supply-side mechanism. Specifically, following ICMW detection, a firm’s demand for a highly able CEO is unlikely to reduce; rather, it may remain flat or increase. Hence, the outcomes we document poten-tially reflect a reputation shock involving firm credibility, thereby affecting the CEO’s decision to supply labor. Further analysis of the new CEO compensation structure provides supporting evidence that new CEOs appointed by firms with ICMW exhibit lower base-salary and non-salary compensations than new CEOs recruited by firms with-out ICMW. Our results using base-salary compensation help us mitigate the concern that our earlier findings for CEO ability could be driven by the negative effect of ICMW on firm performance, which is used as an input to derive Demer-jian et al.’s (2012) CEO ability measure. Because base salary is determined prior to the beginning of the fiscal period and thus is not a function of firm performance, the negative relation between ICMW and base salary indirectly sug-gests that our inferences from CEO ability tests are unlikely to be ex-post determined by the poor performance of ICMW firms. Moreover, to rule out the possibility that our results are due to internally promoted CEOs who may be held responsible for ICMW and thus penalized by the board (Gilson & Vetsuypens, 1993), we re-estimate our models by partitioning the sample into externally hired and internally promoted CEOs. We find that our results are primarily driven by the subsample of firms that hire CEOs from outside, ruling out the alternative explanation that our findings are driven by internally promoted CEOs. 7 Last, we find that both pay dispersion and pay disparity among the top-five executives increase when highly able CEOs are hired by firms with ICMW. Our study contributes to the research on managerial ability and internal controls. To date, much of the inquiry involving these two strands of research has focused on examining the effects of managerial ability and ICMW. We depart from earlier research in that we use ICMW as a setting to understand whether it affects a firm’s ability to attract highly able CEOs, whose ability has been shown in prior research to affect a firm’s credit ratings, loan pric-ing, tax avoidance, quality of management earnings forecasts and overall performance (e.g., Baik et al., 2011; Bonsall et al., 2017; Cornaggia et al., 2017; De Franco et al., 2017; Demerjian et al., 2012; Koester et al., 2017). Our results indicate that, because ICMW can negatively affect the firm performance and thereby perceptions about her human capital, ICMW disclosure has a detrimental effect on the firm’s ability to attract highly able CEOs. Overall, our results indicate that ICMW has economically important consequences on CEO recruitment that could potentially have real effects on the firm and its stakeholders. 7 This finding also addresses the concern that our results may be driven by ICMW firms promoting less able CEOs from inside due to their ineffective perfor-mance evaluations of their employees. 14685957, 2021, 9-10, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jbfa.12560 by Aalto University, Wiley Online Library on [31/07/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License 1944 KHURANA AND KYUNG 

Our study also contributes to the research on executive compensation and internal control quality. Hsu and Liao (2012) find that compensation committees adjust CEO/chief financial officer (CFO) compensation using the auditor opinions on internal control effectiveness, while Liu and Liu (2017) find that the sensitivity of CEO equity portfolios to stock price has a positive impact on firm promptness in remedying ICMWs. Our paper is more related to Hoitash et al. (2012) who find that ICMW disclosures are negatively associated with changes in CFO compensation but not with changes in CEO compensation and interpret the results as suggesting that “boards recognize ICMW disclosures as more relevant for evaluating CFO fiduciary duties than CEO fiduciary duties.” A key difference between the two stud-ies is that Hoitash et al. (2012) relate ICMW to the compensation paid to current CEOs/CFOs who are responsible for the internal control weakness, while our study examines the effects of ICMW on new CEO hiring and compensation. In doing so, the issue of managerial ability represents an important focus of our study. 8 Thus, while our study differs from Hoitash et al. (2012) in terms of the role of ICMW in CEO recruitment, the two studies provide evidence on different aspects of the impact of ICMW on executive compensation. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we discuss prior research and develop our hypoth-esis. Section 3 describes the sample selection and research design. Section 4 reports our empirical results, and Section 5 concludes the paper. 

## 2 RELATED LITERATURE AND TESTABLE HYPOTHESIS 

Our study lies at the intersection of the literature on internal control and managerial ability. In this section, we first provide an overview of these two streams of literature and then develop our hypotheses. 

## 2.1 Effects of ICMW 

The SOX Act, enacted in 2002, aimed at protecting investors “by improving the accuracy and reliability of corporate disclosures made pursuant to the securities laws, and for other purposes” (US Congress 2002). Section 404 of this act requires publicly listed firms to establish and maintain internal controls and conduct and report an assessment of the effectiveness of the issuer’s internal control structure and procedures with respect to financial reporting. 9 Section 404 also requires that the external auditors “attest to, and report on, the assessment made by the management of the issuer” (§404(b), SOX). A significant portion of research in this area has examined whether material internal control weakness reflects a poor internal information environment and whether it has a bearing on a firm’s financial reporting quality. With respect to the internal information environment, Feng et al. (2009) argue that a firm with weak internal controls has lower internal information quality, which can adversely affect a firm’s ability to forecast accurate earnings for the external stakeholders. Consistent with this argument, they find that ICMW is associated with significantly larger management forecast errors. With respect to whether ICMW mars the reliability of a firm’s financial statements, prior research provides evidence linking ICMW disclosures to lower earnings quality (Ashbaugh-Skaife et al., 2008; Chan et al., 2008, Doyle et al., 2007a; Ghosh & Lee, 2013). Other studies have examined whether ICMW has broader effects that extend beyond a firm’s internal informa-tion environment and financial reporting quality. For instance, does ICMW affect a firm’s financing and other costs? Does ICMW lead to sub-optimal firm performance? Empirically evaluating these issues, several studies find that ICMW 8 We also differ sample-wise from Hoitash et al (2012) in that their sample covers 1 year (2005) of data, whereas our sample covers 12 years of data starting in 2005. Another difference is that their sample includes firms reporting under Section 302, which entailed a less rigorous assessment of internal controls (Feng et al. 2009), whereas we require firms in our sample to have an auditor’s opinion under section 404(b) on the effectiveness of internal controls. 9 Section 404(b) became effective for fiscal years ending on or after November 15, 2004, for accelerated filers, defined as US companies with an equity market capitalization exceeding $75 million that file Form 10-K. 14685957, 2021, 9-10, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jbfa.12560 by Aalto University, Wiley Online Library on [31/07/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License KHURANA AND KYUNG 1945 

contributed to a higher cost of equity capital (Ashbaugh-Skaife et al., 2009; Beneish et al., 2008; Ogneva et al., 2007) and a higher cost of debt (Dhaliwal et al., 2011; Kim et al., 2011). Other studies find that ICMW is associated with relationship-specific investments (Lai, 2019), audit costs (e.g., Ettredge et al., 2006; Ettredge et al., 2007; Hogan & Wilkins, 2008; Hoitash et al., 2008; Raghunandan & Rama, 2006) and effective tax rates (Gallemore & Labro, 2015). Focusing on investment decisions, prior research finds that firms with internal control weakness have significantly lower investments (Sun, 2016) and a detrimental effect on firm investment efficiency in that it worsens the impact of financial constraints on under-investment (M. Cheng et al., 2013). Further, Lai et al. (2017) find that ICMW firms show lower operating performance, and Feng et al. (2015) report that once the inventory-related internal control weak-nesses are remediated, firms exhibit better performance. Consistent with this evidence of wide-ranging detrimental effects of ICMW on involved firms, Hammersley et al. (2008) find a negative stock market reaction to the disclosure of ICMW. Taken together, these findings suggest that contracting parties, such as CEO candidates, may perceive a firm’s ICMW to be problematic and factor it into their screening decisions. 

## 2.2 Managerial ability and compensation 

The second line of inquiry relevant to the present study relates to the role of managerial ability and compensation in CEO recruitment. Demerjian et al. (2012) document that there exists considerable heterogeneity in managerial ability, which can affect corporate policies and firm value. Two points are noteworthy here. First, highly able managers are a scarce resource, and hence firms will have to compete to recruit highly able managers (e.g., Gabaix & Landier, 2008; Murphy & Zabojnik, 2007). Using data from the United States, prior research has documented that the competition for managerial talent is intense; it has increased over time and, in part, has contributed to the rise in CEO salaries (e.g., Murphy & Zabojnik, 2004, 2007; Tervio, 2008). Second, managers are concerned about not only their immediate employment but also their long-term labor market prospects. Stated differently, managers consider lifetime earnings as well as current period earnings (Abowd & Ashenfelter, 1981). Taking these points together, the resulting implication is that firms will have to compete to attract highly able managers and that highly able managers will be selective in choosing their employers. Consistent with this view, prior research finds that a firm’s financial distress is positively associated with the level of compensation paid to newly hired CEOs. For example, Gilson and Vetsuypens (1993) document that CEOs who are newly appointed by firms that filed for bankruptcy are paid significantly more than their predecessors. In a similar vein, Chang et al. (2016) find that financially distressed firms pay a compensation premium to new CEOs. Thus, in a similar vein, while higher-ability CEOs would be reluctant to accept offers from ICMW firms, they will command higher compensation by incorporating ICMW into their pricing decisions if they were to accept the offers. 

## 2.3 Hypothesis development 

Our study bridges the inquiry on ICMW and managerial ability and examines whether ICMW affects a firm’s ability to recruit highly able managers. While prior research points to the benefits of employing a more able manager, it is silent on why some firms can recruit highly able managers, while others cannot. This issue is important given the high level of heterogeneity in CEO ability and the extent that a manager’s ability affects her contribution to a firm (see Demerjian et al., 2012). 14685957, 2021, 9-10, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jbfa.12560 by Aalto University, Wiley Online Library on [31/07/2025].

## 2.3.1 ICMW and new CEO ability If a firm discloses an ICMW, it can affect a firm’s ability to compete in recruiting a highly able manager to the firm due to the deleterious effects of ICMW. From the perspective of the potential CEO candidates, a firm with ICMW is problematic because ICMW can be construed as a governance failure that can have an adverse impact on the firm’s performance. Prior research finds that corporate executives seek to safeguard their own reputations and avoid pro-fessional penalties by seeking and accepting job offers from other companies before failure in their firms occurs (Boivie et al., 2012; Gales & Kesner, 1994; Semadeni et al., 2008). Hence, highly able managers may search for other opportu-nities resisting to accept offers extended by ICMW firms. This discussion leads to the following hypothesis (stated in the alternate form as follows): H1: Firms with ICMW hire new CEOs with lower managerial ability, compared to new CEOs at firms without ICMW. While this prediction is plausible, it is possible that our prediction may not be borne out empirically. The reason is that all managers have a price and hence highly able managers can be attracted by offering them a generous com-pensation package. A limitation of this argument is that it presumes that managers care only about their current com-pensation and not their lifetime earnings. If the above argument holds, then it would work against finding evidence supporting our prediction. 2.3.2 ICMW and new CEO compensation In recruiting a CEO, a firm also has to determine the level of compensation it intends to offer to its CEO. The relation between ICMW and CEO compensation is not clear-cut because there are multiple views that speak to this relation. One view is that a firm’s board will pay the level of compensation that is commensurate with its new CEO’s ability. To the extent that ICMW adversely affects a firm’s ability to attract highly able managers, then ICMW will be associated with lower CEO compensation. A contrary view is that ICMW may induce a positive impact on CEO salaries because potential managers perceive employment with an ICMW firm as problematic and risky for their careers. The theory posits that the risk to the value of managerial human capital is not insurable and hence managers will demand a higher level of compensation, irrespective of their level of ability, to account for this human capital risk (e.g., Berk et al., 2010; Berkovitch et al., 2000; Rose, 1992). 10,11 Another view that speaks to the issue of CEO compensation involves the “Lake Wobegon Effect” which posits that firms will tend to distort CEO compensation so as to affect short-run firm value. Specifically, it is argued that firms will pay exorbitant CEO salaries “because no firm wants to admit to having a CEO who is below average” (Hayes & Schaefer, 2009, p.280). Given this distortion in CEO compensation, it is less than clear whether ICMW will be systematically associated with the compensation amount involved. These conflicting arguments about the effects of ICMW on new CEO compensation lead to the following testable hypothesis (stated in the null form): H2: New CEOs at firms with ICMW receive total compensation no different than that received by new CEOs at firms without ICMW. 10 Empirical evidence in support of this prediction includes Chang et al. (2016) who focus on the effects of financial distress, which is posited to hurt managers’ human capital value. They find new CEOs of firms with higher financial distress receive more compensation. 11 While prior evidence suggests that ICMW has a negative effect on firm operations (e.g., Feng et al. 2009, 2015), ICMW, unlike financial distress and bankruptcy, does not pose an imminent threat to a firm’s existence. 14685957, 2021, 9-10, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jbfa.12560 by Aalto University, Wiley Online Library on [31/07/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License KHURANA AND KYUNG 1947 

In summary, we empirically evaluate two research questions. First, does the disclosure of ICMW hamper a firm’s ability to attract high-ability CEOs? Second, does ICMW have a bearing on the compensation offered to newly hired CEOs? 

## 3 SAMPLE SELECTION AND RESEARCH DESIGN 3.1 Sample selection 

Table 1, panel A, reports the sample selection procedure. We obtain our sample of firm-year observations with newly appointed CEOs for US listed firms from ExecuComp in the period from 2005 to 2016. 12 The sample period starts in 2005 because Section 404 of the 2002 SOX Act became effective for fiscal years ending after November 15, 2004. We require each observation to have the data available on Audit Analytics for the auditor’s opinion on the effectiveness of internal controls (AUOPIC = 1-Effective or AUOPIC = 2-Adverse), 1 fiscal year prior to the CEO appointment. Based on the above criteria, we obtain 2079 new CEO observations to construct two samples: managerial ability sample and compensation sample. We merge the sample of executive-level data with the Demerjian et al. (2012) managerial ability scores from Peter Demerjian’s faculty website. 13 We obtain the Compustat and Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP) data for the other variables required for the analyses, and we drop observations with missing values for these variables. To reduce the influence of outliers, all continuous variables are winsorized at the 1% and 99% levels. Our final sample for managerial ability analysis consists of 1570 firm-year observations (1069 unique firms). We follow the same procedure as above to construct a sample for CEO compensation analysis except that we do not require the availability of managerial ability scores. The final sample for CEO compensation analysis consists of 1889 firm-year (1304 unique firms) observations. 14 For some of the tests, there are fewer observations owing to additional data limitations. In panel B, we report the mean and standard deviation of the new CEO ability score and their total compensation by year. By construction, the CEO ability score has a mean close to zero, as this is a residual. The standard deviation of CEO ability scores in a year range between 0.099 and 0.190, indicating that there is a within-year variation in CEO abil-ity scores. On average, CEOs newly appointed in years around the financial crisis command lower compensation than in other years. However, there is an upward trend in the new CEO compensation in the post-financial crisis period. 15 In panel C, we report the mean and standard deviation of CEO ability scores and total compensation by industry. On average, newly appointed CEOs in “healthcare, medical equipment and drugs” industry show the highest CEO ability, whereas those in the “manufacturing” industry show the lowest CEO ability. Also, we find that on average, new CEOs in the “telephone and television transmission” industry command the highest compensation, whereas new CEOs in “utilities” industry show the lowest compensation. Moreover, compensation for newly appointed CEOs in “business equipment” industry shows the greatest dispersion. 12 Our new CEO sample is obtained from ExecuComp data that was downloaded in February 2018. We review executives’ annual titles (TITLEANN), whether the titles include strings “CEO,” “Chief Executive Officer,” or “chief executive officer” for the first time. We filter out subsidiary CEOs from the sample. For each firm, we exclude the first CEO who appears in the ExecuComp because the CEO appointment was made before the firm’s inclusion in the database, and we require information about outgoing CEOs. 13 We thank Professors Demerjian, Lev and McVay for making the data available (http://faculty.washington.edu/pdemerj/data.html). 14 Measures developed by Demerjian et al. (2012) is not available for finance (6000–6999) and utility (4900–4999) industries. Our results from CEO com-pensation tests, when we exclude observations from the regulated industries, are similar to those reported in the paper. 15 In Table 9, we show that our findings are robust to exclusion of CEO appointments in the financial crisis period. 14685957, 2021, 9-10, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jbfa.12560 by Aalto University, Wiley Online Library on [31/07/2025].

## 3.2 Test of H1: CEO ability and ICMW 

## 3.2.1 Empirical model H1 tests whether the internal control environment is associated with the ability of newly appointed CEOs. To test H1, we estimate the following regression model using the ordinary Least Squares (OLS) estimation: 

CEOABILITY i,t = ?? 1ICMW i,t -1 + ?? 1

? FIControls + ?? 2

? FIControls 

+ ?? 3

? CEOControls + ?? i + ?? t + ?? i,t , (1) where CEOABILITY i,t is the CEO ability measure developed by Demerjian et al. (2012). ICMW i ,t-1 is an indicator vari-able equal to one if an auditor’s opinion on the effectiveness of internal controls is adverse and zero otherwise. FICon-trols is a vector of firm inputs, where stock variables are measured in the prior fiscal year and flow variables are measured contemporaneously. FEControls is a vector of contemporaneous firm efficiency determinants identified in Demerjian et al. (2012). 16 CEOControls is a vector of outgoing and incoming CEO characteristics, and the reasons for CEO departures identified in Gentry et al. (2021). A detailed explanation of how each variable is computed is pre-sented in Appendix A and discussed below. We include industry (based on two-digit SIC codes) and year fixed effects to fully absorb time-invariant industry-level heterogeneity and secular time-trend. 17 In terms of H1, the coefficient of interest is ß1 , which represents the relation between the disclosure of ICMW in the prior year and the newly appointed CEO’s ability ( CEOABILITY ). The coefficient, ß1 , is expected to be negative if ICMW adversely affects a firm’s ability to recruit a highly able CEO. Alternatively, the coefficient, ß1 , is expected to be positive if firms with ICMW can attract highly able managers by offering them a generous compensation package. 3.2.2 Dependent variable Our dependent variable CEOABILITY is a measure developed by Demerjian et al. (2012). This measure is a performance-based measure of innate CEO ability. To formulate the measure, Demerjian et al. (2012) derive a DEA measure of firm efficiency. They then regress the efficiency measure on firm efficiency determinants and firm fixed effects. The residual from the regression is the measure of CEO ability, which has been widely used in prior studies (e.g., Baik et al., 2011; Bonsall et al., 2017; Cornaggia et al., 2017; Demerjian et al., 2012,2020). To investigate the extent to which our CEOABILITY measure reflects managerial ability, we use the announcement return ( CAR ) around the press release dates for new CEO appointments as a proxy for the market’s assessment of the incoming CEO’s ability. Specifically, CAR is the cumulative abnormal return for the window ( -1 to +1 trading days) around the announcement day of the new CEO appointments. All abnormal returns are computed as raw returns minus value-weighted market returns. 18 We identify announcement dates of the press releases for 1042 new CEO appoint-ments and compare CARs for high (above median) and low (below median) CEO ability scores based on the Demerjian et al. (2012) measure. For high-ability CEOs, CAR is positive (0.735%) and significant ( p < 0.01). For low-ability CEOs, CAR is negative ( -0.379%) and not significantly different from zero ( p > 0.10). The difference in CARs between the two groups is statistically significant at the 0.01 level. Further, the CEO ability scores from Demerjian et al. (2012) 16 Following suggestions in Chen et al. (2018), we include FIControls and FEControls from Demerjian et al (2012) as control variables to mitigate concerns about incorrect inferences due to our use of residual based measure as a dependent variable in Equation (1). 17 Note that the unit of observation is a new CEO appointment. As such, we only observe within-firm variation if a firm appoints multiple CEOs over the sample periods. In our sample, firms on average appoint new CEOs about 1.5 times during the sample period. Given the data structure, we are unable to include firm-fixed effects in our regressions similar to prior studies on CEO appointments. 18 Citing Fama (1998), Thomas and Zhang (2008, p.913) note that “the choice of the return expectation model is less important in short-window event studies, since daily expected returns are close to zero.” We use the value-weighted market index from CRSP. 14685957, 2021, 9-10, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jbfa.12560 by Aalto University, Wiley Online Library on [31/07/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License 1950 KHURANA AND KYUNG 

and CARs around the new CEO announcements are positively correlated (0.066 (Pearson) and 0.071 (Spearman)) and significant ( p < 0.05). We interpret these results as indicating that the CEO ability measure has a manager-specific element that is valued by the market. 3.2.3 Test variable Our test variable, ICMW is an indicator variable equal to one if an auditor’s opinion on the effectiveness of internal controls is adverse (AUOPIC = 2-Adverse (material weakness exists)) and zero otherwise, (AUOPIC = 1-Effective (no material weakness)). Following prior research (e.g., M. Cheng et al., 2013; Feng et al., 2009, 2015), a firm is deemed to have ineffective internal controls if there is a disclosed ICMW in a particular fiscal year. A material weakness is “a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis” (PCAOB, 2007; Appendix A, para A7). 3.2.4 Control variables Our regression model in Equation (1) includes three sets of control variables: one capturing firm resources ( FIControls ), one controlling for the determinants of firm efficiency ( FEControls ) and one controlling for outgoing and incoming CEO characteristics ( CEOControls ). In addition, we also control for disclosure of restatements ( RESTATEMENT ) prior to CEO appointments, as it can also affect the willingness of individuals to take on the new CEO position. 

FI Controls are variables used by Demerjian et al. (2012) in the DEA optimization procedure: cost of goods sold (COGS ); goodwill ( GOODWILL ); net operating leases ( NET OP LEASE ); net research and development ( NET R&D ); other intangibles ( OTHER INTAN ); net property, plant and equipment ( PPE ); and selling, general and administrative costs (SG&A ). These variables reflect firm resources that are used by managers in the revenue generation process. Follow-ing variable definitions in Demerjian et al. (2012), we measure the stock variables ( PPE, NET OPER LEASE, NET R&D, GOODWILL , and OTHER INTAN ) at the beginning of fiscal year t, whereas the remaining two flow variables ( COGS and 

SG&A ) are measured over fiscal year t.

FEControls refer to six firm efficiency determinants used in Demerjian et al. (2012) to parse out firm efficiency driven by the firm- and management-specific factors: Herfindahl index for business segment concentration that cap-tures operational complexity ( BIZSEGCON ), cash availability ( FCFINDICATOR ), foreign operations ( FOREIGNCURR ), firm size ( LNAT ), life cycle ( LNFIRMAGE ) and firm market share ( MKTSHARE ). As noted by Demerjian et al. (2012), these firm efficiency determinants can affect how firm resources translate into revenue generation holding management-specific factors constant. For example, firm size can affect when managers negotiate the terms with suppliers, influ-encing how managers’ abilities or efforts translate into firm efficiency. Thus, using the variable definitions in Demer-jian et al. (2012), we control for four firm-specific factors (i.e., FCFINDICATOR , LNAT , LNFIRMAGE , MKTSHARE ) that can aid management and two other factors (i.e., BIZSEGCON, FOREIGNCURR ) that can challenge management. 

CEOControls include 11 variables that are related to outgoing and incoming CEO characteristics. Following prior studies on CEO turnover (e.g., Farrell & Whidbee, 2003), we control for outgoing CEO characteristics, including CEO age ( OUTCEOAGE65 ) and outgoing CEO tenure ( OUTCEOTENURE ). The variable OUTCEOAGE65 is intended to distin-guish between retirements and other types of CEO turnover. The variable OUTCEOTENURE is intended to control for the possibility of a succession plan in place for an incoming CEO because a firm is more likely to have the succession plan when an outgoing CEO has a longer tenure with the firm. We also control for reasons for an outgoing CEO’s departure ( DEATH , ILLNESS , DISMISSAL , RETIREMENT , NEWJOB ) using the data provided in Gentry et al. (2021). 19 We also control for several demographic and professional characteristics of incoming CEOs. We control for CEO-chairman 19 We thank Professors Gentry, Harrison, Quigley and Boivie for making the data available (https://zenodo.org/record/4543893#.YGYfzK9KiUk). 14685957, 2021, 9-10, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jbfa.12560 by Aalto University, Wiley Online Library on [31/07/2025].

duality ( CHAIR ) because CEOs receive higher compensation when they also serve as the board chairperson due to their greater influence over the firm (Bebchuk et al., 2002; Grinstein & Hribar, 2004). Following prior studies examining CEO compensation (e.g., Deckop, 1988; Falato et al., 2015; Milbourn, 2003), we control for general experience ( LNCEOAGE )and past CEO and chairman experience at another company ( EXPERIENCE ). We also control for CEO age as a proxy for the horizon problem and its effect on the compensation structure (Gibbons & Murphy, 1992). We control for the CEO gender ( MALE ) because of the gender gap documented in executive compensation studies (Bertrand & Hallock, 2001; Bugeja et al., 2012). 

## 3.3 Test of H2: CEO compensation and ICMW 

## 3.3.1 Empirical model H2 tests whether the ICMW is associated with the compensation paid to newly appointed CEOs. To test H2, we esti-mate the following regression model using the OLS estimation: 

NEWCEOPAY i,t = ?? 1ICMW i,t -1 + ?? 1

? FIRMControls + ?? 2

? FIRMControls 

+ ?? i + ?? t + ?? i,t , (2) where NEWCEOPAY is the natural logarithm of the annual compensation of newly appointed CEOs. FIRMControls is a vector of firm-level control variables identified in prior research as determinants of CEO compensation. These con-trol variables consist of firm-specific characteristics, which are measured as of the fiscal year immediately preced-ing the CEO appointment. CEOControls is a vector of outgoing and incoming CEO characteristics. Variable definitions are available in Appendix A and discussed below. Other model specifications are consistent with that discussed in Equation (1). In terms of H2, the coefficient of interest is ß1 , which represents the relation between the disclosure of ICMW and the newly appointed CEO’s annual total compensation ( NEWCEOPAY ). The coefficient, ß1 , is expected to be negative if ICMW impairs a firm’s ability to recruit a highly able CEO and to the extent that CEO compensation is commensurate with CEO ability. Alternatively, the coefficient, ß1 , is expected to be positive if CEOs perceive employment with an ICMW firm as problematic and risky for their careers and require a higher level of compensation. 3.3.2 Dependent variable Our dependent variable NEWCEOPAY is the natural logarithm of total CEO compensation in the first year of her appointment, LNTotalPay . We use the ExecuComp variable TDC 1 as the measure of total CEO compensation. Following prior studies (see, e.g., J. J. Choi et al., 2020; Sloan, 1993; Vefeas, 2003), we log transform the measure to control for skewness in the CEO compensation distribution. CEO total compensation includes the CEO’s base salary, bonus, other annual compensation, the total value of restricted stock granted, the total value of stock options granted (valued using Black–Scholes), long-term incentive payouts and all other compensation. 3.3.3 Control variables We control for a series of firm-specific ( FIRMControls ) and CEO-specific ( CEOControls ) characteristics variables that are identified in prior research (e.g., Q. Cheng & Farber, 2008; Core et al., 1999; Dai et al., 2020; Farrell & Whidbee, 14685957, 2021, 9-10, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jbfa.12560 by Aalto University, Wiley Online Library on [31/07/2025].

2003) to affect CEO compensation. FIRMControls include firm size ( LNAT ), financial leverage ( LEVERAGE ), cash con-straint ( CASHCSTR ), growth opportunities ( MTB and R&D ), firm performance ( ROA and CAR ), the stock return volatility (RETVOL ), the number of business and geographic segments ( SEGMENT ) and the disclosure of past error restatements (RESTATEMENT ). CEOControls are as defined in Section 3.1. 

## 4 EMPIRICAL RESULTS 4.1 Descriptive statistics 

Panel A of Table 2 reports summary statistics for the regression variables. The mean of CEOABILITY is 0.005, which is higher than the mean of -0.004 reported in Demerjian et al. (2012) for their full sample of more than 175,000 obser-vations. The standard deviation of CEOABILITY for our sample is 0.145, which is similar to that for the full sample in Demerjian et al. (2012). The mean (median) of LNTotalPay is 8.092 (8.165). When we separate the total compensa-tion into base salary and others, the mean (median) of LNSalary and LNNonSalary is 6.185 (6.299) and 7.799 (7.997), respectively. The mean values of ICMW are 0.048 and 0.051 for CEO ability and compensation samples, respectively, indicating that around 5% of the new CEOs in our samples are appointed by ICMW firms. Of the 1889 new CEOs in our CEO compensation test sample, 25% are appointed as a successor of an outgoing CEO who is 65 or older. 20 Also, on average, outgoing CEOs spend 6 years in office before turnover. In our sample, 23% of outgoing CEOs are dismissed, 65% of outgoing CEOs are retiring, 8% of incoming new CEOs are appointed to serve as chairman of the board and 95% are male. In panel B, we compare differences in mean and median values for variables used in regressions between new CEO observations appointed by firms with and without ICMW. On a univariate basis, CEO ability is significantly lower and CEO compensation is significantly smaller for CEOs who are recruited following ICMW disclosures. These univariate results suggest that firms with internal control weakness recruit relatively lower ability managers and commensurate with the CEO ability recruited, these firms offer lower compensation. We caveat these results by noting that none of the other variables identified in prior research to affect these variables are controlled for in these univariate comparisons. The mean values of several control variables for the two groups are also significantly different from each other. For the CEO ability test sample, GOODWILL , NET R&D , PPE , SG&A , FOREINGCURR are significantly greater for firms that appointed new CEOs after disclosing ICMW. Further, firms that did not disclose ICMW are, on average, larger ( LNAT ), report a greater cost of goods sold ( COGS ) and have a greater market share ( MKTSHARE ). For the CEO compensation test sample, on average, firms without ICMW show better market ( CAR ) and operational ( ROA ) performance. Further, they are greater in size ( LNAT ), higher in the market-to-book ratio ( MTB ) and lower in cash constraint ( CASHCSTR )and stock returns volatility ( RETVOL ). For both CEO ability and compensation test samples, firms that did not disclose ICMW tend to have a greater proportion of outgoing CEOs with an age of 65 or above ( OUTCEOAGE65 ) and longer outgoing CEO tenure ( OUTTENURE ). Given the large differences in characteristics between firms with and without ICMW, we also test our hypotheses using entropy-balanced samples, an approach described in Hainmueller (2012) and McMullin and Schonberger (2020) to ensure covariate balance by construction. Specifically, we use entropy balancing to create a sample that exhibits covariate balance on the first moment for all control variables. 4.1.1 Correlations Table 3 provides pairwise correlations among variables used in our regressions. In panel A, the Pearson correlation between CEOABILITY and ICMW is negative and significant ( p < 0.10), indicating that firms with ICMWs recruit CEOs 20 The mean value of outgoing CEO age in our sample is 60. 14685957, 2021, 9-10, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jbfa.12560 by Aalto University, Wiley Online Library on [31/07/2025].

with lower ability. Moreover, 12 of the 25 control variables are significantly correlated with the dependent variable (p < 0.10) based on Pearson correlations. The highest magnitude of the absolute value of those correlations is 0.40. In panel B, the Pearson correlation between LNTotalPay and ICMW is negative and significant ( p < 0.10), indicating that firms with ICMW recruit CEOs with lower compensation. Of the 21 control variables, 14 are significantly correlated with the dependent variable ( p < 0.10) based on Pearson correlations. The highest magnitude of the absolute value of those correlations is 0.53. 21 

## 4.2 Empirical results: Test of H1 

Panel A of Table 4 reports the OLS regression results of estimating Equation (1) using ICMW firms along with the unmatched control firm sample. In column 1 of panel A, the estimated coefficient on ICMW is negative and significant (p < 0.05), when CEOABILITY is the dependent variable, suggesting that firms recruit new CEOs with lower ability following the ICMW disclosures. In terms of economic magnitude, the estimated coefficient on ICMW suggests that the ability score of new CEOs appointed by firms that announced ICMW is, on average, 0.028 lower when compared to other new CEOs firms in the same two-digit SIC industry. Considering that the standard deviation is 0.145 and the difference between the lower quartile and median is 0.050, the economic magnitude is significant. This finding provides support for the view that the disclosure of ICMW hampers a firm’s ability to attract high-ability CEOs in that they hire CEOs with lower ability. The coefficients on the control variables are generally consistent with our expectations. For example, the estimated coefficient on LNAT is positive and significant, suggesting that larger firms attract high-ability CEOs. Also, consistent with our discussion in Section 3.1 that the ability of new CEOs appointed by firms in the “manufacturing” industry is lower, the estimated coefficient on COGS , NET OP LEASE , PPE and SG&A are negative and significant. Similarly, the estimated coefficient on NET R&D is positive and significant, consistent with the notion that high-ability CEOs are recruited by firms in the “healthcare, medical equipment and drugs” industry. In columns 2–5, we re-estimate Equation (1) using four other incoming CEO characteristics as dependent variables: CEO age ( LNCEOAGE ); new CEO appointment to serve as the chairman of the board ( CHAIR ); CEO’s past experience in serving as CEO and the chairman of the board of another company ( EXPER ); and gender ( MALE ). None of the CEO characteristics exhibits a significant association with ICMW. 22 Panel B of Table 4 reports the OLS regression results of estimating Equation (1) using the sample of ICMW firms, along with the entropy-balanced control firm samples. In column 1, the estimated coefficient on ICMW is negative and significant ( p < 0.01), suggesting that the negative relation between ICMW and new CEO ability is unlikely to be driven by differences between firms with and without ICMW. Further, the magnitude of the estimated coefficient on ICMW is similar to what is reported in panel A, suggesting that our results in panel A are unlikely to be driven by the difference between firms with and without ICMW. With respect to the other four CEO characteristics, the estimated coefficient on ICMW is positive (negative) and significant when LNCEOAGE (EXPER ) is the dependent variable, suggesting the ICMW firms hire new CEOs who are relatively older with less experience as CEO in the past. Overall, the results in Table 4 provide strong evidence that the disclosure of weak internal controls is associated with the recruitment of lower-ability CEOs. 21 We diagnose multicollinearity in the regressions using variance inflation factors (VIFs). The VIF for control variables in any of our regressions never exceeded 5.46, suggesting that no large correlations could induce collinearity problems in our multivariate analysis. 22 For EXPER in column 4, we also estimated the model using the multinomial logistic regression because having past experience in serving as CEO ( EXPER = 1) and having past experience in serving in dual roles as CEO and chair of the board ( EXPER = 2) may not be a natural ordering. However, because the multinomial logistic regression does not converge even when we expand the number of iterations, we report the result using the ordered logistic regression. 14685957, 2021, 9-10, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jbfa.12560 by Aalto University, Wiley Online Library on [31/07/2025].

Time subscript t refers to the year that the CEO joins the company. Industry fixed effects are based on the two-digit SIC code. All continuous variables are winsorized at 1% and 99%. 

p-values are reported in parentheses. ***, ** and * denote significance at the 1%, 5% and 10% levels based on two-tailed tests, respectively. 

## 4.3 Empirical results: Test of H2 

Table 5 presents the results of the OLS estimation of Equation (2). The first (last) three columns of Table 5 report the regression results using the sample of ICMW firms, along with the unmatched (entropy-balanced) control firm sam-ples. Because our inferences remain the same irrespective of the estimation, we discuss the results in detail using the unmatched pooled sample. In column 1, using LNTotalPay as a dependent variable, the estimated coefficient on ICMW 

is negative and significant ( p < 0.10). This result suggests that new CEOs appointed following the ICMW disclosures are, on average, paid less when compared to their peers in the same two-digit SIC industry. In terms of economic mag-nitude, the estimated coefficient on ICMW suggests that the total compensation is lower by 15.1% ( = exp( -0.164) – 1) for new CEOs appointed by ICMW firms. The coefficients on the control variables are generally consistent with our expectations. For example, the estimated coefficient on LNAT is positive and significant, suggesting that larger firms pay CEOs more. This result is also consis-tent with our finding in Table 4 that larger firms recruit CEOs with higher ability. The positive and significant estimated coefficients on MTB and R&D suggest that firms with greater growth potential pay higher compensation to new CEOs. The positive and significant estimated coefficient on EXPER suggests that firms pay more when recruiting CEOs with past experience as a CEO and chairman of the board at another company. The negative and significant estimated coef-ficient on LNCEOAGE suggests that new CEOs are paid less when they are offered the opportunity to lead a company at a later age, which is consistent with the notion that capable individuals climb the corporate ladder more quickly. In columns 2 and 3, we separate the total CEO compensation into base salary ( LNSalary ) and non-salary compensa-tion ( LNNonSalary ). For the base sample, the coefficient on ICMW is negative and significant ( p < 0.01) for base salary and the coefficients on ICMW are negative and significant ( p < 0.01) for both components of total CEO compensation when using the entropy-balanced sample. In terms of economic magnitude, the coefficients suggest that base-salary and non-salary compensations are lower by 20.1% ( = exp( -0.224) – 1) and 20.9% ( = exp( -0.235) – 1) for new CEOs recruited following ICMW disclosure. In short, the results in Table 4 indicate that new CEOs appointed by firms that announce ICMW exhibit lower total, base-salary and non-salary compensations than new CEOs recruited by other firms in the same industry. 23 23 In untabulated analyses, we also examine whether this negative relation between ICMW and compensation is observed for newly appointed CFOs. Using 2685 newly appointed CFOs over the same sample period, we do not find statistically significant relation between ICMW and LNTotPay , LNSalary and LNNon-Salary . When using entropy-balanced sample, we find a negative association between ICMW and LNSalary for newly appointed CFOs. Specifically, it suggests that new CFOs appointed by ICMW firms earn 7.8% less base salary than new CFOs appointed by non-ICMW firms. The weaker evidence for new CFOs may be due to the different nature of labor market for CFOs and CEOs. While CEOs are recruited from more broader spectrum of candidates with more diverse outside opportunities, CFOs typically are required to have certain qualifications. For example, more than 75% of CFOs hold professional certification in accounting and finance (see, e.g., Florackis & Sainani 2018). Thus, it is possible that the lower heterogeneity in ability of potential CFO candidates, less 14685957, 2021, 9-10, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jbfa.12560 by Aalto University, Wiley Online Library on [31/07/2025].

## 4.4 Additional analysis 

In this section, we conduct a series of additional analyses. First, we test whether CEO ability moderates the association between ICMW and new CEO’s compensation, Second, we examine whether the negative association between ICMW and CEO compensation comes from the subsample of firms that externally hire CEOs or firms that internally promote CEOs or both. Last, we examine whether ICMW has a bearing on the relational pay pattern for newly hired CEOs among the top-five executives. 4.4.1 Effect of high ability CEO appointments So far, we show that CEO ability is significantly lower and CEO compensation is significantly smaller for CEOs who are recruited following ICMW disclosures. In this section, we investigate whether the relation between internal control weakness and new CEO compensation varies with the new CEO’s ability. We argue that a firm still needs to recog-nize an individual CEO’s ability and pay a premium for higher gradations of CEO ability. As such, the negative relation between ICMW and CEO compensation should be attenuated for new CEOs with more ability. pronounced effects of CFO ability on firm performance and a fewer set of diverse job opportunities available to potential CFO candidates may account for the weak evidence when we examine the relation of ICMW with CFO compensation. Also, the weak evidence for CFO compensation is consistent with the notion that our CEO ability test results are likely to be driven by recruitment of lower ability CEOs by ICMW firms rather than other executives. 14685957, 2021, 9-10, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jbfa.12560 by Aalto University, Wiley Online Library on [31/07/2025].

To test whether CEO ability moderates the association between ICMW and new CEO’s compensation, we estimate the following regression model using the OLS estimation: 

NEWCEOPAY i,t = ?? 1ICMW i,t -1 + ?? 2ICMW i,t -1 × HIGHABILITY i,t 

+ ?? 3HIGHABILITY i,t + ?? ? Controls + ?? i + ?? t + ?? i,t , (3) where HIGH ABILITY equals one if a firm appoints a highly able CEO, that is, top quartile in CEO ability, and zero oth-erwise. 24 All other variables are defined as before. The coefficient ß2 represents the effect of recruiting a high-ability CEO on the relation between the disclosure of ICMW in the prior year and the newly appointed CEO’s annual com-pensation ( NEWCEOPAY ). The coefficient, ß2 , is expected to be positive if firms recognize individual CEO ability and pay a premium to attract highly able CEOs, who are more likely to have other options and require a higher level of compensation for accepting an offer at ICMW firms. Table 6 presents the results of the OLS estimation of Equation (3). Note that the number of observations for this estimation is smaller because we require that the CEO compensation sample also have data on CEO ability. The first (last) column uses the ICMW firms along with the unmatched (entropy-balanced) control firms. Consistent with our findings in Table 5, the estimated coefficient on ICMW in column 2 is negative and significant ( p < 0.01). The coeffi-cient on HIGH ABILITY is not significant, suggesting that among non-ICMW firms, CEO pay does not differ significantly between higher and lower ability CEOs. A potential explanation for an insignificant coefficient on HIGH ABILITY is that the ability measure computed by Demerjian et al. (2012) is based on multiple firm-level characteristics, many of which we control for in estimating Equation (3). 25 Further, the estimated coefficient on ICMW x HIGH ABILITY is positive and significant ( p < 0.01), suggesting that the negative relation between ICMW disclosures and new CEO compensation is attenuated if ICMW firms recruit highly able CEOs. In terms of economic magnitude, the estimated coefficients on ICMW and ICMW x HIGH ABILITY in column 2 suggest that the total compensation is lower by 23.7% ( = exp( -0.271) – 1) for new CEOs appointed following ICMW disclosures, while the total compensation is higher by 80.7% ( = exp(0.715) – 1 – 23.7%) when ICMW firms recruit a highly able CEO. These findings suggest that while firms with internal control weakness recruit lower ability CEOs who earn less total annual compensation (corroborating our findings in Tables 4 and 5), high-ability CEOs command higher compensation when accepting the job offers from ICMW firms. 4.4.2 Externally hired versus internally promoted CEOs An alternative explanation for the negative association between new CEO compensation and ICMW we document could be that it is due to internally promoted CEOs who are held responsible for ICMW and penalized by the board (Gilson & Vetsuypens, 1993). In this section, we address the alternative explanation by examining whether the nega-tive association between ICMW and CEO compensation comes from the subsample of firms that externally hire CEOs or firms that internally promote CEOs or both. Further, prior research on the insider-outsider CEO choice has noted that outside candidates are “handicapped” when it comes to CEO hiring decisions in that they are likely to be chosen only if they are “markedly better” than candidates within a firm (Agrawal et al., 2006). Other research (e.g., Gilson & Vetsuypens, 1993; Larcker & Tayan, 2016) has noted that it is more common to promote insiders to the CEO position and that externally hired CEOs command higher salaries. Since we are interested in analyzing subsample of firms hir-ing an insider or an outsider as the CEO, we follow prior research (e.g., Farrell & Whidbee, 2003; Huson et al., 2001; 24 Results are similar when we use top quintile to define HIGH ABILITY .25 To assess the reasonableness of this explanation, we re-estimate Equation (3) without controlling for any firn characteristics. We find that the estimated coefficient on ICMW is -0.428 ( p < 0.01), ICMW x HIGH ABILITY is 0.643 ( p < 0.05), and HIGH ABILITY is 0.335 ( p < 0.01). In other words, the collinearity of  

> HIGH ABILITY with several firm characteristics could account for the lack of statistical significance. 14685957, 2021, 9-10, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jbfa.12560 by Aalto University, Wiley Online Library on [31/07/2025].

Parrino, 1997) and identify insider CEOs as those who have been present at the firm as a top-five non-CEO executive for 1 or more fiscal years prior to her appointment as CEO. In our sample, approximately 61% of newly appointed CEOs have been with the firm for more than 1 year (i.e., CEOs classified as insiders). In Table 7, we present the results of the OLS estimation of Equations (2) and (3), separately for the externally hired CEO sample and the internally promoted CEO sample. Further, we report results using the base sample and the entropy-balanced sample. Consistent with our findings in Tables 5 and 6, the estimated coefficients on ICMW are neg-ative and significant ( p < 0.10) in columns 1–4 for the externally hired CEOs, suggesting that new CEOs recruited from outside are paid less when they are appointed following ICMW disclosure. Also, the estimated coefficient on ICMW x

HIGH ABILITY is positive and significant ( p < 0.01) in column 4, suggesting that highly able outsider CEOs command higher compensation when hired by ICMW firms. For internally promoted CEOs, the estimated coefficient on ICMW 

in columns 5 and 7 are not statistically significant, which could potentially be due to the fact that internally promoted CEOs are likely to be more willing to assume the CEO role, despite ICMW issues because they are already at that par-ticular firm. We also note that the estimated coefficients on ICMW x HIGH ABILITY in columns 6 and 8 are positive and significant, suggesting that ICMW firms pay a premium to retain the high-ability CEO when an internally promoted CEO is highly capable. This finding is consistent with the notion that highly capable employees have better outside options. 26 Overall, the results in Table 7 suggest that our findings are primarily driven by a subsample of firms that hire CEOs from outside. 26 It is worth noting that if an ICMW firm failed to retain an internal CEO candidate, then that ICMW firm is likely to recruit a CEO from outside, and this sample observation will be included in columns 1–4 of Table 7. Thus, it is possible that ICMW firms that succeed in retaining capable CEOs used higher compensation to attract them to the CEO position, and it is these firms that are selected into columns 5–8 covering internally promoted CEOs. 14685957, 2021, 9-10, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jbfa.12560 by Aalto University, Wiley Online Library on [31/07/2025].

All other variables are defined as before. In Equation (4), the coefficient ß2 represents the effect of multiple control weaknesses on the relation between the disclosure of ICMW in the prior year and the newly appointed CEO’s annual compensation ( NEWCEOPAY ). 14685957, 2021, 9-10, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jbfa.12560 by Aalto University, Wiley Online Library on [31/07/2025].

Table 8 presents the results of the OLS estimation of Equations (4). The first (last) column uses the ICMW firms along with the unmatched (entropy-balanced) control firms. The estimated coefficient on ICMW x MULTIPLE WEAK-NESS is negative and significant ( p < 0.01) suggesting that the negative relation between ICMW disclosures and new CEO compensation is more pronounced if ICMW firms report more than one type of control weaknesses. In terms of economic magnitude, the estimated coefficients on ICMW x MULTIPLE WEAKNESS in column 2 suggest that the total compensation is lower by 24.6% ( = exp( -0.282) – 1) for new CEOs appointed following more than one type of ICMW disclosures. These findings suggest that our findings in Table 5 are primarily driven by more severe cases of ICMW that report multiple types of control weakness. 27 4.4.4 Compensation disparity/dispersion Additional analyses so far have focused almost exclusively on the relation of ICMW and CEO compensation. However, the literature on executive compensation acknowledges that relational pay patterns among executives reflect the rel-ative importance of the CEO among the top-five executive team (Bebchuk et al., 2011). To shed light on relational pay patterns for newly hired CEOs, we compare the compensation of the recruited CEO to the rest of the top-four execu-tives of the firm and relate the relational pay patterns with the presence of ICMW. 28 If a high-ability CEO is recruited and a premium paid to attract the CEO to a firm with ICMW, then ICMW will positively affect the distance between the recruited CEO’s compensation and that of the existing executives in the firm. In other words, ICMW will serve to increase pay disparity. Besides pay disparity, ICMW will also increase the variation in the compensation of the top executives if ICMW necessitates a premium to attract a potential CEO to the firm involved. We compute pay disparity (LNPayDisparity ) as the natural logarithm of total annual CEO compensation divided by the mean of other executives’ total annual compensation and pay dispersion ( LNPayDispersion ) as the natural logarithm of the standard deviation of the total annual compensation of five executives including the CEO. Table 9 present the OLS regression results of estimating Equations (2) and (3) by replacing the dependent variable, 

LNCEOTotPay , first with LNPayDisparity and then LNPayDispersion . The first two columns for each dependent variable are based on our base sample, while the last two columns are based on an entropy-balanced sample. In columns 1 and 3, the coefficients on ICMW are not statistically significant ( p > 0.10). However, the coefficient on ICMW is negative and significant ( p < 0.01) and the estimated coefficient on ICMW x HIGH ABILITY is positive and significant ( p < 0.01) in column 4, suggesting that pay disparity among executives diminishes when new CEOs are recruited by ICMW firms, but the disparity becomes greater when highly able CEOs hired. In terms of economic magnitude, the estimated coef-ficient on ICMW in column 4 suggests that the pay disparity is lower by 15.4% ( = exp( -0.167) – 1) for ICMW firms when compared to other firms in the same two-digit SIC industry. The estimated coefficient on ICMW x HIGH ABIL-ITY suggests that the pay disparity is higher by 64.7% ( = exp(0.588) – 1 – 18.6%) when ICMW firms recruit highly able CEOs. Our results are similar in columns 5–8 when using LNPayDispersion as a dependent variable. These findings suggest that new CEO appointments following ICMW disclosures also have bearing on the disparity and dispersion in executive compensation, corroborating our main findings that ICMW firms hire lower ability CEOs with relatively lesser importance among the top-five CEOs. 27 Following a reviewer’s suggestion, we also investigated the conditional effects of core versus non-core and pervasive (entity level) versus non-pervasive (account level) weaknesses on new CEO compensation. We use the same definitions as used by Q. Cheng et al. (2018) to classify internal control weaknesses into core, non-core, pervasive and non-pervasive categories. Untabulated results using these classifications for conditional analyses do not yield any mean-ingful (statistically significant) results. 28 We require that compensation of at least five executives including the CEO is available and that the compensation of each executive is greater than $100K. 14685957, 2021, 9-10, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jbfa.12560 by Aalto University, Wiley Online Library on [31/07/2025].

## 4.5 Robustness tests 

We subject our regression results to a number of robustness checks in order to address potential concerns about estimation. First, we estimate the relation between ICMW and CEO compensation by excluding interim CEO appoint-ments from our sample. Columns 1 and 2 of Table 10 present the regression results using the reduced sample. For both the base and the entropy-balanced samples, the coefficients on ICMW continue to be negative and statistically signifi-cant, suggesting that our findings are not driven by a subset of CEOs who take the position temporarily and thus may command lower compensation. Second, we estimate the relation between ICMW and CEO compensation by excluding CEO appointments made during fiscal periods that overlap with the financial crisis period (December 2007–June 2009) as defined by National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER). The coefficients on ICMW in columns 3 and 4 of Table 10 are negative and statistically significant. The basic tenor of our results is unaltered when we exclude the financial crisis period, which could drive lower CEO compensation due to worsening economic conditions. Third, to address the concern that our findings may be driven by a subset of firms that appoint CEOs multiple times during our sample period, we estimate the relation between ICMW and CEO compensation for our sample restricted to the first CEO appointment only for each firm. For both base and entropy-balanced samples in columns 5 and 6 of Table 10, we find that the key inference from Table 5 continues to hold, suggesting that our findings are not driven by firms that are included in the sample multiple times. Last, in the last two columns of Table 10, we estimate the relation between ICMW and CEO compensation for a matched sample based on CEO departure reasons ( DEATH , ILLNESS , DISMISSAL , RETIREMENT , NEWJOB ), two-digit SIC code and firm size measured as the book value of total assets. This matching procedure yields 91 matched pairs of CEO appointments. Based on 182 CEO appointment observations of the base sample in column 7, we do not find 14685957, 2021, 9-10, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jbfa.12560 by Aalto University, Wiley Online Library on [31/07/2025].

## 5 CONCLUSION 

This paper examines an issue that arises from the intersection of two lines of inquiry involving CEO ability and ICMW. Prior research has noted that a CEO is a critical employee who has a significant impact on firm value and perfor-mance. However, there is considerable variation in managerial ability and high ability managers are considered a scarce resource. Given its import and scarcity, it is argued that the market for high-ability managers is intensively competitive. Separately, the literature on ICMW contends that it hurts a firm’s information environment and as a result produces a wide range of adverse effects, which include a higher cost of external financing as well as low-quality earnings forecasts by managers. Given its impact on firm performance, we examine whether the disclosure of ICMW adversely impacts a firm’s ability to recruit a high-ability CEO. Based on our empirical analysis, we report three main findings. First, we find ICMW disclosures to be negatively associated with the hiring of a high-ability CEO. This is consistent with the idea that potential CEO candidates with high ability will avoid ICMW firms because of its adverse effects on firm performance. It is worth noting that some high ability CEOs do take positions at ICMW firms and that ICMW firms need to pay a premium for these high ability CEOs. Second, we find ICMW is associated with a lower level of CEO compensation. This finding points to ICMW having an impact on CEO contracting. More importantly, the evidence suggests that firms offer the newly hired CEO com-pensation that is, on average, commensurate with the level of CEO ability. However, we also find that firms distinguish and do take into account individual CEO ability in that the negative impact on ICMW on CEO compensation is atten-uated as the level of CEO ability rises. Finally, to further gauge the impact of ICMW on CEO recruitment, we examine the impact of ICMW on the top-five executive team’s pay dispersion and disparity. We find ICMW is associated with both lower pay dispersion and disparity. These findings corroborate our earlier results that ICMW is associated with smaller new CEO compensation amounts and this is likely to the adverse impact of ICMW on the recruitment of high-ability managers. In general, our findings are not sensitive to the components of compensation: salary and non-salary compensations. Our study addresses a lacuna in the literature by examining whether potential CEO candidates consider a firm’s information environment in agreeing to an employment relationship with a firm. The theoretical research has noted that managers consider their lifetime earnings and the value of their human capital in making these decisions. Our empirical evidence provides support for this notion. CEO candidates exhibit an awareness of the ill effects of ICMW on managerial and firm performance and hence tend to avoid these firms to shield the value of their human capital.

We appreciate the comments of Matt Glendenning, Felipe Silva and attendees at the 2019 AAA annual meeting. We also thank Professors Demerjian, Lev and McVay for the use of their managerial ability data and Pro-fessors Gentry, Harrison, Quigley and Boivie for making the data on the reasons for CEO turnover publicly available. Other data that supports the findings of this study are publicly available in Audit Analytics, Compustat, CRSP and ExecuComp. 29 While we have in total 96 CEO appointments with ICMW disclosure in our sample, five of them did not have a matched CEO appointment with the same reasons for CEO departure and two-digit SIC industry. We also applied a more restrictive matching procedure by adding CEO appointment year as an addi-tional matching criterion. This approach resulted in 75 matched pairs of CEO appointments, but the entropy-balancing process did not converge for the matched sample. 14685957, 2021, 9-10, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jbfa.12560 by Aalto University, Wiley Online Library on [31/07/2025].

APPENDIX A: Variable definitions Variable Definition Dependent variables :

CEOABILITY CEO ability measure developed by Demerjian et al. (2012). Demerjian et al. (2012) first formulate a DEA measure of firm efficiency. To isolate CEO-specific effects, they regress the measure on efficiency determinants and firm fixed effects. The residual from this regression is the measure of CEO ability 

LNTotalPay Natural logarithm of total annual compensation for newly appointed CEO in thousand dollars ( TDC 1) 

LNSalary Natural logarithm of annual salary compensation for newly appointed CEO in thousand dollars ( SALARY )

LNNonSalary Natural logarithm of annual non-salary compensation for newly appointed CEO in thousand dollars ( TDC 1 - SALARY )

LNPayDisparity Natural logarithm of total annual CEO compensation divided by the mean of other executives’ total annual compensations ( TDC 1). We require at least five executive compensations, including CEO compensation and each compensation to be greater than $100K 

LNPayDispersion Natural logarithm of the standard deviation of all total annual compensations ( TDC 1). We require at least five executive compensations, including CEO compensation and each compensation to be greater than $100K 

Test variable :

ICMW One if a firm reports ICMW and zero otherwise 

Control variables :Firm input variables 

COGS Cost of goods sold ( COGS ) scaled by lagged sale ( SALE )

GOODWILL Purchased goodwill ( GDWL ) scaled by lagged sale ( SALE )

NET OP LEASE Net operating leases scaled by sale ( SALE ). Net operating leases are calculated as the discounted present value of the next five years of required operating lease payments (MRC 1– MRC 5). Consistent with Demerjian et al. (2012), we use a 10% discount rate 

NET R&D Net research and development expenses scaled by lagged sale ( SALE ). Net research and development expenses are the sums of R&D expenses ( XRD ) over a 5-year capitalization period 

OTHER INTAN Other acquired and capitalized intangibles ( INTAN –GDWL ) scaled by lagged sale ( SALE )

PPE Net property, plant and equipment ( PPENT ) scaled by lagged sale ( SALE )

SG&A Selling, general and administrative expenses ( XSGA ) scaled by lagged sale ( SALE )

Firm efficiency determinants 

BIZSEGCON Herfindahl index for business segment concentration, measured as the square of the ratio of individual business segment sales to total sales ( SALE ), summed across all business segments. If the firm is not in the segment file, it is assigned a concentration of one 

FCFINDICATOR One if a firm has nonnegative free cash flow, which is defined as earnings before depreciation and amortization (OIBDP) less the change in working capital ( RECT + INVT +

ACO – LCO – AP ) less capital expenditures ( CAPX )) and zero otherwise 14685957, 2021, 9-10, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jbfa.12560 by Aalto University, Wiley Online Library on [31/07/2025].

MKTSHARE Sales ( SALE ) divided by total revenues generated by all Compustat universe firms in the same Fama–French 48 industries 

Firm characteristics 

CAR Cumulative abnormal daily stock returns ( RET ) in a year adjusted by value-weighted market returns ( VWRETD ). We use daily stock returns from CRSP and require at least 120 returns
