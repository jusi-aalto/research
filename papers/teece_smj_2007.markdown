This paper draws on the social and behavioral sciences in an endeavor to specify the nature and microfoundations of the capabilities necessary to sustain superior enterprise performance in an open economy with rapid innovation and globally dispersed sources of invention, innovation, and manufacturing capability. Dynamic capabilities enable business enterprises to create, deploy, and protect the intangible assets that support superior long-run business performance. The microfoundations of dynamic capabilities—the distinct skills, processes, procedures, organizational structures, decision rules, and disciplines—which undergird enterprise-level sensing, seizing, and reconfiguring capacities are difficult to develop and deploy. Enterprises with strong dynamic capabilities are intensely entrepreneurial. They not only adapt to business ecosystems, but also shape them through innovation and through collaboration with other enterprises, entities, and institutions. The framework advanced can help scholars understand the foundations of long-run enterprise success while helping managers delineate relevant strategic considerations and the priorities they must adopt to enhance enterprise performance and escape the zero profit tendency associated with operating in markets open to global competition.

## INTRODUCTION
Recent scholarship stresses that business enterprises consist of portfolios of idiosyncratic and difficult-to-trade assets and competencies (‘resources’).¹ Within this framework, competitive advantage can flow at a point in time from the ownership of scarce but relevant and difficult-to-imitate assets, especially know-how. However, in

¹ The reference here is to the resource-based theory of the enterprise advanced by Rumelt (1984), Wernerfelt (1984), Amit and Schoemaker (1993), and others. Some of my earlier work (Teece, 1980, 1982) was also in this vein.

fast-moving business environments open to global competition, and characterized by dispersion in the geographical and organizational sources of innovation and manufacturing, sustainable advantage requires more than the ownership of difficult-to-replicate (knowledge) assets. It also requires unique and difficult-to-replicate dynamic capabilities. These capabilities can be harnessed to continuously create, extend, upgrade, protect, and keep relevant the enterprise’s unique asset base. For analytical purposes, dynamic capabilities can be disaggregated into the capacity (1) to sense and shape opportunities and threats, (2) to seize opportunities, and (3) to maintain competitiveness through enhancing, combining, protecting, and, when necessary, reconfiguring the business enterprise’s intangible and tangible assets. Dynamic capabilities include difficult-to-replicate enterprise

capabilities required to adapt to changing customer and technological opportunities. They also embrace the enterprise’s capacity to shape the ecosystem it occupies, develop new products and processes, and design and implement viable business models. It is hypothesized that excellence in these ‘orchestration’² capacities undergirds an enterprise’s capacity to successfully innovate and capture sufficient value to deliver superior long-term financial performance. The thesis advanced is that while the long-run performance of the enterprise is determined in some measure by how the (external) business environment rewards its heritage, the development and exercise of (internal) dynamic capabilities lies at the core of enterprise success (and failure). This paper first describes the nature of dynamic capabilities, and then explicates their microfoundations.

The ambition of the dynamic capabilities framework is nothing less than to explain the sources of enterprise-level competitive advantage over time, and provide guidance to managers for avoiding the zero profit condition that results when homogeneous firms compete in perfectly competitive markets. A framework, like a model, abstracts from reality. It endeavors to identify classes of relevant variables and their interrelationships. A framework is less rigorous than a model as it is sometimes agnostic about the particular form of the theoretical relationships that may exist. Early statements of the<|control464|> capabilities framework can be found in Teece, Pisano, and Shuen (1990a, 1990b, 1997) and Teece and Pisano (1994). An extensive literature on dynamic capabilities now exists (e.g., Helfat et al., 2007) that can be organized and integrated into the general framework offered here.

As indicated, the possession of dynamic capabilities is especially relevant to multinational enterprise performance in business environments that display certain characteristics. The first is that the environment is open to international commerce and fully exposed to the opportunities and threats associated with rapid technological change. The second is that technical change itself is systemic in that multiple inventions must be combined to create products and/or services that address customer needs. The third is that there are well-developed global markets for the exchange of (component) goods and services; and the fourth is that the business environment is characterized by poorly developed markets in which to exchange technological and managerial know-how. These characteristics can be found in large sectors of the global economy and especially in high-technology sectors. In such sectors, the foundations of enterprise success today depend very little on the enterprise’s ability to engage in (textbook) optimization against known constraints, or capturing scale economies in production. Rather, enterprise success depends upon the discovery and development of opportunities; the effective combination of internally generated and externally generated inventions; efficient and effective technology transfer inside the enterprise and between and amongst enterprises; the protection of intellectual property; the upgrading of ‘best practice’ business processes; the invention of new business models; making unbiased decisions; and achieving protection against imitation and other forms of replication by rivals. It also involves shaping new ‘rules of the game’ in the global marketplace. The traditional elements of business success—maintaining incentive alignment, owning tangible assets, controlling costs, maintaining quality, ‘optimizing’ inventories—are necessary but they are unlikely to be sufficient for sustained superior enterprise performance.

Executives seem to recognize new challenges in today’s globally competitive environments and understand how technological innovation is necessary but not sufficient for success. A. J. Lafley, CEO of Proctor & Gamble, notes that ‘the name of the game is innovation. We work really hard to try to turn innovation into a strategy and a process ... ’.³ Sam Palmisano, CEO of IBM, remarks that ‘innovation is about much more than new products. It is about reinventing business processes and building entirely new markets that meet untapped customer demand.’⁴ Put differently, there is an emerging recognition by managers themselves that the foundations of enterprise success transcend simply being productive at R&D, achieving new product introductions, adopting best practice, and delivering quality products and services. Not only

² The management functions identified are analogous to that of an orchestra conductor, although in the business context the ‘instruments’ (assets) are themselves constantly being created, renovated, and/or replaced. Moreover, completely new instruments appear with some frequency, and old ones need to be abandoned. While flexibility is certainly an element of orchestration, the latter concept implies much more.

must the innovating enterprise spend heavily on R&D and assiduously develop and protect its intellectual property; it must also generate and implement the complementary organizational and managerial innovations needed to achieve and sustain competitiveness.

As indicated, not all enterprise-level responses to opportunities and threats are manifestations of dynamic capabilities. As Sidney Winter (2003: 991) notes, ‘ad hoc problem solving’ isn’t necessarily a capability. Nor is the adoption of a well-understood and replicable ‘best’ practice likely to constitute a dynamic capability. Implementing best practice may help an enterprise become or remain viable, but best practices that are already widely adopted cannot by themselves in a competitive market situation enable an enterprise to earn more than its cost of capital, or outperform its competitors. Likewise, invention and innovation by themselves are insufficient to generate success (Teece, 1986).

Two yardsticks can be proposed for calibrating capabilities: ‘technical’ fitness and ‘evolutionary’ fitness (Helfat et al., 2007). Technical fitness is defined by how effectively a capability performs its function, regardless of how well the capability enables a firm to make a living. Evolutionary or external fitness refers to how well the capability enables a firm to make a living. Evolutionary fitness references the selection environment. Helfat et al. (2007) further note that both technical and evolutionary fitness range from zero to some positive value. These yardsticks are consistent with the discussion here. Dynamic capabilities assist in achieving evolutionary fitness, in part by helping to shape the environment. The element of dynamic capabilities that involves shaping (and not just adapting to) the environment is entrepreneurial in nature. Arguably, entrepreneurial fitness ought to have equal standing with evolutionary fitness.

Dynamic capabilities have no doubt been relevant to achieving competitive advantage for some time. However, their importance is now amplified because the global economy has become more open and the sources of invention, innovation, and manufacturing are more diverse geographically and organizationally (Teece, 2000), and multiple inventions must be combined to achieve marketplace success (Somaya and Teece, 2007). Achieving evolutionary fitness is harder today than it was before the millennium. Moreover, regulatory and institutional structures must often be reshaped for new markets to emerge; and as discussed later, the ubiquity of ‘platforms’ must now be recognized (Evans, Hagiu, and Schmalensee, 2006).

While the development and astute management of intangible assets/intellectual capital is increasingly recognized as central to sustained enterprise competitiveness, the understanding of why and how intangibles are now so critical still remains opaque and is not addressed by orthodox frameworks. What is needed is a new framework for business and economic analysis. As former U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan remarked, ‘we must begin the important work of developing a framework capable of analyzing the growth of an economy increasingly dominated by conceptual products.’⁵ The dynamic capabilities approach developed here endeavors to be responsive to this challenge at the enterprise level.

In an earlier treatment (Teece et al., 1997: 530) it was noted that ‘we have merely sketched an outline for a dynamic capabilities approach.’ In what follows, the nature of various classes of dynamic capabilities is identified, and an effort is made to separate the microfoundations of dynamic capabilities from the capability itself. Put differently, important distinctions are made between the organizational and managerial processes, procedures, systems, and structures that undergird each class of capability, and the capability itself. One should note that the identification of the microfoundations of dynamic capabilities must be necessarily incomplete, inchoate, and somewhat opaque and/or their implementation must be rather difficult. Otherwise sustainable competitive advantage would erode with the effective communication and application of dynamic capability concepts.

Of course, the existence of processes, procedures, systems, and structures already ubiquitously adopted by competitors does not imply that these have not in the past been the source of competitive advantage, or might not still be a source of competitive advantage in certain contexts. For example, studies of the diffusion of organizational innovations (e.g., Armour and Teece, 1978; Teece, 1980)

⁵ Chairman Alan Greenspan also noted recently, “over the past half century, the increase in the value of raw materials has accounted for only a fraction of the overall growth of U.S. gross domestic product (GDP). The rest of the growth reflects the embodiment of ideas in products and services that consumers value. This shift of emphasis from physical materials to ideas as the core of value creation appears to have accelerated in recent decades.” (Remarks of Alan Greenspan, Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research, 2004.)

indicate that diffusion is by no means instantaneous, and that profits can persist for many years before being competed away. Decade-long adoption cycles for new business structures and procedures (e.g., performance measurement systems) are not uncommon. Uncertain imitability (Lippman and Rumelt, 1982) may also serve to slow the diffusion process and support persistent differential performance.

Fortunately, the existing literature on strategy, innovation, and organization and the new literature on dynamic capabilities have identified a panoply of processes and routines that can be recognized as providing certain microfoundations for dynamic capabilities. For instance, Eisenhardt and Martin (2000) identify cross-functional R&D teams, new product development routines, quality control routines, and technology transfer and/or knowledge transfer routines, and certain performance measurement systems as important elements (microfoundations) of dynamic capabilities. The effort here is not designed to be comprehensive, but to integrate the strategy and innovation literature and provide an umbrella framework that highlights the most critical capabilities management needs to sustain the evolutionary and entrepreneurial fitness of the business enterprise.

## SENSING (AND SHAPING) OPPORTUNITIES AND THREATS

### Nature of the capability
In fast-paced, globally competitive environments, consumer needs, technological opportunities, and competitor activity are constantly in a state of flux. Opportunities open up for both newcomers and incumbents, putting the profit streams of incumbent enterprises at risk. As discussed in Teece et al. (1997), some emerging marketplace trajectories are easily recognized. In microelectronics this might include miniaturization, greater chip density, and compression and digitization in information and communication technology. However, most emerging trajectories are hard to discern. Sensing (and shaping) new opportunities is very much a scanning, creation, learning, and interpretive activity. Investment in research and related activities is usually a necessary complement to this activity.

Opportunities get detected by the enterprise because of two classes of factors. First, as stressed by Kirzner (1973), entrepreneurs can have differential access to existing information. Second, new information and new knowledge (exogenous or endogenous) can create opportunities, as emphasized by Schumpeter (1934). Kirzner stressed how the entrepreneurial function recognizes any disequilibrium and takes advantage of it. The Kirznerian view is that entrepreneurship is the mechanism by which the economy moves back toward equilibrium. Schumpeter, on the other hand, stressed upsetting the equilibrium. As Baumol (2006: 4) notes, ‘the job of Schumpeter’s entrepreneur is to destroy all equilibria, while Kirzner’s works to restore them. This is the mechanism underlying continuous industrial evolution and revolution.’ Equilibrium is rarely if ever achieved (Shane, 2003). Both forces are relevant in today’s economy.

To identify and shape opportunities, enterprises must constantly scan, search, and explore across technologies and markets, both ‘local’ and ‘distant’ (March and Simon, 1958; Nelson and Winter, 1982). This activity not only concerns investment in research activity and the probing and reprobing of customer needs and technological possibilities; it also involves understanding latent demand, the structural evolution of industries and markets, and likely supplier and competitor responses. To the extent that business enterprises can open up technological opportunities (through engaging in R&D and through tapping into the research output of others) while simultaneously learning about customer needs, they have a broad menu of commercialization opportunities. Overcoming a narrow search horizon is extremely difficult and costly for management teams tied to established problem-solving competences. Henderson (1994) notes that General Motors (GM), IBM, and Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) encountered difficulties because they became prisoners of the deeply ingrained assumptions, information filters, and problem-solving strategies that made up their world views, turning the solutions that once made them great into strategic straitjackets.

When opportunities are first glimpsed, entrepreneurs and managers must figure out how to interpret new events and developments, which technologies to pursue, and which market segments to target. They must assess how technologies will evolve and how and when competitors, suppliers, and customers will respond. Competitors may or may not see the opportunity, and even if they

do they may calibrate it differently. Their actions, along with those of customers, suppliers, standard-setting bodies, and governments, can also change the nature of the opportunity and the manner in which competition will unfold.

There are also constraints on the rules by which competitive forces will play out. These constraints are imposed by regulators, standard-setting bodies, laws, social mores, and business ethics. The shape of the ‘rules of the game’ is thus the result of co-evolution and complex interaction between what might be thought of as (business) ecosystem participants. Because of uncertainty, entrepreneurs/managers must make informed conjectures about the path ahead. These conjectures become working hypotheses that can be updated as evidence emerges. Once a new evolutionary path becomes apparent, quick action is needed.

### Microfoundations
The literature on entrepreneurship emphasizes that opportunity discovery and creation can originate from the cognitive and creative (‘right brain’) capacities of individual(s). However, discovery can also be grounded in organizational processes, such as research and development activity. The ability to create and/or sense opportunities is clearly not uniformly distributed amongst individuals or enterprises. Opportunity creation and/or discovery by individuals require both access to information and the ability to recognize, sense, and shape developments. The ability to recognize opportunities depends in part on the individual’s capabilities and extant knowledge (or the knowledge and learning capacities of the organization to which the individual belongs) particularly about user needs in relationship to existing as well as novel solutions. This requires specific knowledge, creative activity, and the ability to understand user/customer decision making, and practical wisdom (Nonaka and Toyama, 2007). It involves interpreting available information in whatever form it appears—a chart, a picture, a conversation at a trade show, news of scientific and technological breakthroughs, or the angst expressed by a frustrated customer. One must accumulate and then filter information from professional and social contacts to create a conjecture or a hypothesis about the likely evolution of technologies, customer needs, and marketplace responses. This task involves scanning and monitoring internal and external technological developments and assessing customer needs, expressed and latent. It involves learning, interpretation, and creative activity.

While certain individuals in the enterprise may have the necessary cognitive and creative skills, the more desirable approach is to embed scanning, interpretative, and creative processes inside the enterprise itself. The enterprise will be vulnerable if the sensing, creative, and learning functions are left to the cognitive traits of a few individuals.⁶ Organizational processes can be put in place inside the enterprise to garner new technical information, tap developments in exogenous science, monitor customer needs and competitor activity, and shape new products and processes opportunities. Information must be filtered, and must flow to those capable of making sense of it. Internal argument and discussion about changing market and technological reality can be both inductive and deductive. Hypothesis development, hypothesis ‘testing,’ and synthesis about the meaning of information obtained via search are critical functions, and must be performed by the top management team. The rigorous assembly of data, facts, and anecdotes can help test beliefs. Once a synthesis of the evidence is achieved, recurrent synthesis and updating can be embedded in business processes designed by middle management and/or the planning unit in the business organization (Casson, 1997). If enterprises fail to engage in such activities, they won’t be able to assess market and technological developments and spot opportunities. As a consequence, they will likely miss opportunities visible to others.

As noted in Teece et al. (1997), more decentralized organizations with greater local autonomy are less likely to be blindsided by market and technological developments. Because of the problem of information decay as information moves up (and down) a hierarchy, businesses must devise mechanisms and procedures to keep management informed. Bill Hewlett and David Packard developed ‘management by walking about’ (Packard, 1995) as a mechanism to prevent top management at Hewlett-Packard from becoming isolated from

⁶ In a limited sense, that is about decision making under uncertainty. As Knight observes, with uncertainty there is ‘a necessity to act upon opinion rather than knowledge’ (Knight, 1921: 268). The problem is not just about knowledge asymmetries and incentive problems as Alchian and Demsetz (1972) seem to suggest. Rather, it involves filtering and interpreting information about evolving technologies and marketplaces.

what was going on at lower levels in the enterprise, and outside the enterprise as well. In other organizations (e.g., professional services) the management ranks can be filled by leading professionals who remain involved with professional work. This protects them from the hazards of managerial isolation.

The search activities that are relevant to ‘sensing’ include information about what’s going on in the business ecosystem. With respect to technologies, R&D activity can itself be thought of as a form of ‘search’ for new products and processes. However, R&D is too often usually a manifestation of ‘local’ search. ‘Local’ search is only one component of relevant search. In fast-paced environments, with a large percentage of new product introductions coming from external sources, search/exploration activity should not just be local. Enterprises must search the core as well as to the periphery of their business ecosystem. Search must embrace potential collaborators—customers, suppliers, complementors—that are active in innovative activity.

Customers are sometimes amongst the first to perceive the potential for applying new technology. Visionary members of customer organizations are often able to anticipate the potential for new technology and possibly even begin rudimentary development activities. Moreover, if the suppliers of new technology do not succeed in properly understanding user/customer needs, it is unlikely that new products they might develop will be successful. Indeed, one of the most consistent findings from empirical research is that the probability that an innovation will be successful commercially is highly correlated with the developers’ understanding of user/customer needs (Freeman, 1974). Electronic computing and the Internet itself can rightly be viewed as having a significant component of user-led innovations. Business enterprises that are alert and sense the opportunity are often able to leverage customer-led efforts into new products and services, as the users themselves are frequently ill prepared to carry initial prototypes further forward.

Suppliers can also be drivers of innovation important in the final product. Innovation in microprocessor and DRAMs is a classic case. This upstream or ‘component’ innovation has impacted competition and competitive outcomes in personal computers, cellular telephony, and consumer electronics more generally. Failure to ‘design in’ new technology/components in a timely fashion will lead to failure; conversely, success can sometimes be achieved by continuous rapid ‘design in.’ Indeed, continuous and rapid design around new technology/components developed elsewhere can itself be a source of durable competitive advantage. Put differently, with rapid innovation by component suppliers, downstream competitive success can flow from the ability of enterprises to continuously tap into such (external) innovation ahead of the competition. External search and acquisition of technology have been going on for decades, but as Chesbrough (2003) explains, ‘open innovation’ is now a mandate for enterprise success.

The concept and practice of open innovation underscore the importance of broad-based external search and subsequent integration involving customers, suppliers, and complementors. Establishing linkages between corporations and universities assists broad-based search, as university programs are usually unshackled from the near at hand. Indeed, a recent study of patenting in the optical disk industry (Rosenkopf and Nerkar, 2001) seems to suggest that exploration that is more confined generates lower impacts, and that the impact of exploration is highest when exploration spans organizational (but not technological) boundaries. However, it is not just a matter of searching for external inventions/innovations that represent new possibilities. Frequently it is a matter of combining complementary innovations so as to create a solution to a customer problem. The systemic nature (Teece, 2000) of many innovations compounds the need for external search.

Sensing opportunities and threats can also be facilitated if the enterprise and/or the entrepreneur explicitly or implicitly employs some kind of analytical framework, as this can help highlight what is important. The field of strategic management has been stranded for some time with a framework that implicitly assumes that industry structure (and product market share), mediated by enterprise behavior, determines enterprise performance. In Porter’s (1980) Five Forces framework, a good strategy involves somehow picking an attractive industry and positioning oneself to be shielded from competition. Porter’s approach mandates ‘industry’ analysis⁷ and the calibration of five distinct industry-level forces: the role of

⁷ The Five Forces framework undergirds ‘industry’ analysis in business school curriculum and in practice. However, the very concept of an industry is itself of questionable value.

potential entrants, suppliers, buyers, substitutes, and rivalry amongst competitors. Because of its rather static nature and the fact that it ignores many aspects of the competitive environment including the role of complementaries, path dependencies, and supporting institutions, its application in the contexts outlined in the Introduction of this paper will limit the ability of the entrepreneur and/or the enterprise to properly sense opportunities and threats and properly calibrate strengths, weaknesses, and technological and market trajectories. If network effects, path dependencies, and the co-evolution of technologies and institutions are significant, the Five Forces framework is of limited utility.

The Five Forces framework has inherent weaknesses in dynamic environments. Fundamental is that it implicitly views market structure as exogenous, when in fact market structure is the (endogenous) result of innovation and learning.⁸ Changes in science and technology create opportunities for innovation. Enterprises can search amongst new possibilities and engage in development activities. If successful, such development impacts the relative fate of firms. This in turn determines market structure. Outcomes for individual enterprises are shaped in part by the selection processes at work in the business ecosystem. Relevant factors ignored or underplayed by Five Forces include technological opportunities, path dependencies, appropriability conditions, supporting institutions, robotics, installed base effects, learning, certain switching costs, and regulation. In short, in regimes of rapid technological change with well-developed markets for goods and services (and poorly developed markets for know-how), the Five Forces framework is compromised because it has insufficient appreciation (a) for the importance and nature of innovation and other factors that change the ‘rules of the game,’ (b) for factors inside the business enterprise that constrain choices, (c) for factors that impact imitation and appropriability issues, (d) for the role of supporting institutions, complementary assets, cospecialization, and network externalities, or (e) for the blurred nature of industry boundaries. Also, as discussed later, in many ‘platform’ industries or where there is significant outsourcing, scale is an industry asset.

The dynamic capabilities approach of a strong break with Five Forces. Within the dynamic capabilities framework, the ‘environmental’ context recognized for analytical purposes is not that of the industry, but that of the ‘business’ ecosystem’—the community of organizations, institutions, and individuals that impact the enterprise and the enterprise’s customers and supplies. The relevant community therefore includes complementors, suppliers, regulatory authorities, standard-setting bodies, the judiciary, and educational and research institutions. It is a framework that recognizes that innovation and its supporting infrastructure have major impacts on competition. The dynamic capabilities approach of is grounded in Kirznerian, Schumpeterian, and evolutionary theories of economic change, whereas Five Forces is grounded in the Mason-Bain paradigm of industrial economics.⁹ Also, whereas according to Porter the essence of strategy formulation is ‘coping with competition’ (Porter, 1991: 11), in the dynamic capabilities tradition the essence of strategy involves selecting and developing technologies and business models that build competitive advantage through assembling and orchestrating difficult-to-replicate assets, thereby shaping competition itself.

Even when utilizing the ecosystem as the organizing paradigm for assessing developments in an enterprise, the full import of particular facts, statistics, and developments is rarely obvious. Accordingly, the evaluative and inferential skills possessed by an organization and its management is important. Indeed, much of the information gathered and communicated inside the enterprise has minimal decision relevance. Even if relevant, it often arrives too late. Management must find methods and procedures to peer through the fog of uncertainty and gain insight. This involves gathering and filtering technological, market, and competitive information from both inside and outside the enterprise, making sense of it, and figuring out implications for action. However, because attention is a scarce resource inside the enterprise (Cyert and March, 1963), management must carefully allocate resources to search and discovery. The enterprise’s articulated strategy can become a filter so that attention is not diverted to every opportunity and threat that ‘successful’ search reveals. Likewise, scenario planning can collapse likely situations into a small number of scenarios that can facilitate cognition, and then action, once uncertainty is resolved. Figure 1 summarizes individual and enterprise traits that undergird sensing capabilities.

⁸ Indeed, the (basic) market structure-conduct-performance paradigm from industrial economics that undergirds the Five Forces approach has been needs of revision for quite some time. Phillips (1971) was perhaps the first to recognize that causation is the reverse of what is assumed, with market structure being shaped by innovation.
⁹ Developed in the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s, it is still relevant to some of the ‘rust belt’ industries that experience low rates of technological innovation where complementors are not important, and where the co-evolution of technologies and institutions is not significant (Teece, 1990).

### SEIZING OPPORTUNITIES

#### Nature of the Capability
Once a new (technological or market) opportunity is sensed, it must be addressed through new products, processes, or services. This almost always requires investments in development and commercialization activity. Multiple (competing) investment paths are possible, at least early on. The quintessential example is the automobile industry, where in the early days different engine technologies—steam, electric, and gasoline—each had their champions. Once a dominant design begins to emerge, strategic choices become much more limited. This paradigm, which was first offered by Abernathy and Utterback (1978) and then built upon by Teece (1986, 2007), now has considerable evidence supporting it over a wide range of technologies (Klepper and Graddy, 1990; Utterback and Suarez, 1993; Malerba and Orsenigo, 1996). It implicitly recognizes inflexion points in technological and market evolution. These inflexion points impact investment requirements and strategic choices. Implications for investment decisions have been noted elsewhere (Teece, 1986) and include staying flexible until the dominant design emerges and then investing heavily once a design looks like it can become the winner. Any strategy is, of course, likely to be fraught with hazards because of uncertainties. Moreover, the manner and time at which an enterprise needs to place its bets depend on competition in the ‘input’ markets and on the identity of the enterprise itself. Mitchell (1991) suggests that the timing of resource commitments can differ according to the enterprise’s existing positions with respect to the relevant complementary assets. Enterprises that are well positioned can wait, while those that are not must scramble.

Addressing opportunities involves maintaining and improving technological competences and complementary assets and then, when the opportunity is ripe, investing heavily in the particular technologies and designs most likely to achieve marketplace acceptance. When network externalities are present, early entry and commitment are necessary. The presence of increasing returns means that if one network gets ahead, it tends to stay ahead. Getting ahead may require significant upfront investments. Customers will not want an enterprise’s products if there are strong network effects and the installed base of users is relatively small. Accordingly, one needs to strategize around investment decisions, getting the timing right, building on increasing return advantages, and leveraging products and services from one application to another. The capacity to make high-quality,

unbiased but interrelated investment decisions in the context of network externalities, innovation, and change is as rare as decision-making errors and biases are ubiquitous.

However, the issue that the enterprise faces is not just when, where, and how much to invest. The enterprise must also select or create a particular business model that defines its commercialization strategy and investment priorities. Indeed, there is considerable evidence that business success depends as much on organizational innovation, e.g., design of business models, as it does on the selection of physical technology. This is true at the enterprise level as well as at the economy-wide level (Nelson, 2005). Indeed, the invention and implementation of business models and associated enterprise boundary choices involve issues as fundamental to business success as the development and adoption of the physical technologies themselves. Business models implicate processes and incentives; their alignment with the physical technology is a much overlooked component of strategic management. The understanding of the institutional/organizational design issues is typically more limited than the understanding of the technologies themselves. This ignorance affords considerable scope for mistakes around the proper design of business models and the institutional structures needed to support innovation in both the private and public sectors.

In theory, one could imagine transactions between entities that scout out and/or develop opportunities, and those that endeavor to execute upon them. In reality, the two functions cannot be cleanly separated, and the activities must be integrated inside a single enterprise, where new insights about markets—particularly those that challenge the conventional wisdom—will likely encounter negative responses. The promoters/visionaries must somehow defeat the naysayers, transform internal views, and facilitate necessary investment. Some level of managerial consensus is necessary to allow investment decisions to be made. Investment will likely involve committing financial resources behind an informed conjecture about the technological and marketplace future. However, managers of established product lines in large organizations can sometimes have sufficient decision-making authority to starve the new business of financial capital. This posture can be buttressed by capital budgeting techniques that more comfortably support investments for which future cash flow can be confidently projected. In short, the new can lose out to the established unless management is sensitive to the presence of certain biases in accepted investment decision processes. An important class of dynamic capabilities emerges around a manager’s ability to override certain ‘dysfunctional’ features of established decision rules and resource allocation processes.

It helps to begin by recognizing that decision-making processes in hierarchically organized enterprises involve bureaucratic features that are useful for many purposes, but they nevertheless may muzzle innovation proclivities. In particular, a formal expenditure process involving submissions and approvals is characteristic of ‘well-managed’ companies. Decision making is likely to have a committee structure, with top management requiring reports and written justifications for significant decisions. Moreover, approvals may need to be sought from outside the organizational unit in which the expenditure is to take place. While this may ensure a matching up of expenditures to opportunities across a wider range of economic activity, it unquestionably slows decision making and tends to reinforce the status quo. Committee decision-making structures almost always tend toward balancing and compromise. But innovation is often ill served by such structures, as the new and the radical will almost always appear threatening to some constituents. Strong leaders can frequently overcome such tendencies, but such leaders are not always present. One consequence is a ‘program persistence bias.’ Its corollary is various forms of ‘anti-innovation bias,’ including the ‘anticannibalization’ basis discussed in a later section. Program persistence refers to the funding of programs beyond what can be sustained on the merits, and follows from the presence or influence of program advocates in the resource allocation process. This proclivity almost automatically has the countervailing effect of reducing funds available to new initiatives.

One should not be surprised, therefore, if an enterprise senses a business opportunity but fails to invest. In particular, incumbent enterprises tend to eschew radical competency-destroying innovation in favor of more incremental competency-enhancing improvements. The existence of layer upon layer of standard procedures, established capabilities, complementary assets, and/or administrative routines can exacerbate decision-making biases against innovation. Incumbent enterprises,

relying on (path-dependent) routines, assets, and strategies developed to cope with existing technologies, are handicapped in making and/or adopting radical, competency-destroying, noncumulative innovation (Nelson and Winter, 1982; Tushman and Anderson, 1986; Henderson and Clark, 1990). This is true whether the competence is external to the firm or internal to the firm.

Evidence also shows that decision-makers discount outcomes that are merely probable in comparison with outcomes that are certain. This has been called the certainty effect (Kahneman and Lovallo, 1993). It contributes to excessive risk aversion when choices involve possible losses. Further, to simplify choices between alternatives, individuals generally evaluate options in isolation. Viewing each alternative as unique leads decision-makers to undervalue possibilities for risk pooling. This approach to decision making may produce inconsistent preferences and decision biases (timid choices) that lead to outcomes that block innovation (Kahneman and Tversky, 1979; Kahneman and Lovallo, 1993). An opposing bias to loss/risk aversion is excessive optimism. This leads to investment in low or negative return projects. As a result, entry decisions often fail. Audretsch (1995) found that over the period 1976–86 the average 10-year failure rate in two-digit SIC manufacturing sectors ranged from 75.8 percent to 54.8 percent. Similar failure rates have been reported in other studies (Dunne, Roberts, and Samuelson, 1988; Klepper and Miller, 1995). However, these failure rates disguise wide variation amongst particular enterprises and between new entrants and incumbents.

The existence of established assets and routines exacerbates problems of excessive risk aversion. Specifically, both the isolation effect and the certainty effect can be intensified by the existence of established assets, causing incumbent enterprises to become comparably more risk averse than new entrants. In terms of innovative activity, this excessive risk aversion leads to biased decision making and limits the probability that incumbent enterprises will explore risky radical innovations. In short, success in one period leads to the establishment of ‘valid’ processes, procedures, and incentives to manage the existing business. This can have the unintended effect of handicapping the new business. The proficiency with which such biases are overcome and a new opportunity is embraced is likely to depend importantly on the quality of the enterprise’s routines, decision rules, strategies, and leadership around evaluating new investment opportunities. Business historians (e.g., Chandler, 1990a; Lazonick, 2005) and others have reminded us that over the long run the ability of enterprises to commit financing and invest astutely around new technologies is critical to enterprise performance.¹⁰

In regimes of rapid technological innovation, it is clear that making investment choices requires special skills not ubiquitously distributed amongst management teams. Nor are they ubiquitously distributed amongst investors.¹¹ Resource/asset alignment and coalignment issues are important in the context of innovation, but they are quite different from portfolio balance issues faced by financial investors. The presence of increasing returns means that one also needs to strategize around investment decisions, getting the timing right, building on increasing return advantages, and leveraging products and services from one application to another. Value-enhancing investments inside the knowledge-based enterprise are often cospecialized¹² to each other. Also, the nature of the portfolio ‘balance’ needed inside the enterprise is different from the portfolio balance sought by pure financial investors. The economics of cospecialization are not the economics of covariance with which investors are familiar with. In short, the task of making astute project- and enterprise-level investment decisions is quite challenging because of cospecialization, and irreversibilities.

The project finance and related literatures provide tools and clear decision rules for project selection once cash flows are specified, uncertainty and/or risk are calibrated, and interdependencies

¹⁰ Consider the development of civilian jet transport aircraft in the United States in the 1950s. As Phillips (1971: 126) noted: ‘Any one of Boeing, Douglas, Lockheed, or Convair might have been first. ... The technology was there to adapt to—not risklessly to be used, but it was there. Perhaps the biggest risk in 1953 was not technological in character. Instead, it was risk with respect to what sort of jet to build and when to build it.’
¹¹ The decision skills required of management have limited commonality with those of an investor. One difference is the illiquidity and irreversibility of most managerial investment decisions. Another is the need to achieve continuous alignment amongst the assets at work in the enterprise. Both public and private equity investors typically lack this kind of orchestration and integration capability or capacity. Moreover, their skills are most applicable when investments are liquid.
¹² Cospecialization is defined and discussed in Teece (1986) and explored further in the section below entitled ‘Managing threats and reconfiguration.’

between and amongst cash flows are ignored. However, the essence of the investment decision for the (strategic) manager is that it involves estimating interdependent future revenue streams and cost trajectories, and understanding a panoply of continuous and interrelated cospecialized investment issues.¹³ The returns to particular cospecialized assets cannot generally be neatly apportioned or partitioned. As a result, the utility of traditional investment criteria is impaired. Thus while project-financing criteria financing (e.g., discounted cash flow, payback periods and the like) and techniques for decision making decision under uncertainty are well known, there is little recognition of how to value intangibles and take into account features such as cospecialization, irreversibility, and opportunity costs.¹⁴ Nor is the concept of a ‘strategic investment’ recognized in the finance literature. Finance theory provides almost no guidance with respect to how to estimate future cash flows, although making such estimates is as much, if not more, the essence of good decision making as are the methodologies and procedures for analyzing cash flow.

In summary, managers need to make unbiased judgments under uncertainty around not just future demand and competitive responses associated with multiple growth trajectories, but also around the pay-offs from paying-offs from making interrelated investments in intangible assets. In the world of tangible assets, this can sometimes be precisely modeled; not so for the world of cospecialized intangibles. In essence, the organizational challenge appears to be that in environments experiencing rapid change, activities are not fully decomposable. Cross-functional activities and associated investments must take place concurrently, rather than sequentially, if enterprises are to cut time-to-market for new products and processes. Managerial judgments (decision-making skills) take on great significance in such contexts. This was also true during prior centuries, as Alfred Chandler’s (1990a, 1990b) analysis of successful enterprises from the 1870s through the 1960s makes

¹³ makes apparent. Monteverde and Teece’s (1982) study of the automobile industry showed that ‘systems integration’ considerations impacted make-buy decisions. This evidence hints at the value to be created from figuring out intables and tangibles and protocols likely to aid decisions involving inter related investments. Evans, Hagia, and Schmalia (2006) recognize multisided market interdependentcies which likewise require interdependent investments.
¹⁴ Ghemawat (1991) and many others have examined uncertainty and irreversibilities. However, cospecialization has received very little attention.

apparent. No matter how much analytical work is done, tacit investment skills are of great importance. Chandler further argues that success in the late-nineteenth and much of the twentieth century came to those enterprises that pursued his ‘three-pronged’ strategy: (1) early and large-scale investments behind on new technologies; (2) investment in product-specific marketing, distribution, and purchasing networks; and (3) recruiting and organizing and the managers needed to supervise and coordinate functional activities. The first and second elements require commitment to investments where irreversibilities and cospecialization are identified. While the nature of required investments may have changed in recent decades (less decomposable/more than interrelated), investment decision-making skills remain important.

### Microfoundations
#### Selecting product architectures and business models
The design and performance specification of a products, and the business model employed, all help define the manner by which the enterprise delivers value to customers, entices customers to pay for value, and converts those payments to profit. They reflect management’s hypothesis about what customers want and how an enterprise can best meet those needs, and get paid for doing so. They embrace: (1) which technologies and features are to be embedded in the product and service; (2) how the revenue and cost structure of a business is to be ‘designed’ and if necessary ‘redesigned’ to meet customer needs; (3) the way in which technologies are to be assembled; (4) the identity of market segments to be targeted; and (5) the mechanisms and manner by which value is to be captured. The function of a business model is to ‘articulate’ the value proposition, select the appropriate technologies and features, identify targeted market segments, define the structure of the value chain, and estimate the cost structure and profit potential (Chesbrough and Rosenbloom, 2002: 529-534). In short;, a business model is a plan for the organizational and financial ‘architecture’ of a business. This model makes assumptions about the behavior of revenues and costs, and likely customer and competitor behavior. It outlines the contours of the solution required to earn a profit, if a profit is available to be earned. Once adopted it defines the way the enterprise ‘goes to market.’ goes. Success requires

*D. J. Teece*

that business models must be astutely crafted. Otherwise, technological innovation will not result in commercial success for the innovating enterprise. Generally there is a plethora of business models that can be designed and employed, but some will be better adapted to the ecosystem than others. Selecting, adjusting, and/or improving the business model is a complex art.

Nevertheless, the importance of a ‘business models’ has been given short shrift in the academic literature, at least until quite recently. Important (business model) choices include technological choices, market segments to be targeted, financial terms (e.g., sales vs. leasing), choices with respect to bundled vs. unbundled sales strategies, joint ventures vs. licensing vs. go-it-alone approaches for a, example, etc. For example, in fact, in the early days of the copier industry, Xerox focused on leasing rather than selling copiers. This stemmed from a belief that customer trial would lead to further use. Another example from the United States is that Southwest Airlines, which believes that most customers want low frills, reliability, and low cost. It eschews avoids the hub-and-spoke model, does not belong to any alliances, and does not allow interlining of passengers and baggage. Nor does it sell tickets through travel agencies—all agencies, as sales are direct. All its aircraft are Boeing 737s. Its business model is quite distinct from the major carriers, although many have tried (without much success) to copy elements of the Southwest model.¹⁵

The capacity an enterprise has a to create, adjust, hone, and, if necessary, replace business models is foundational to dynamic capabilities. Choices around how to capture value all help determine the architecture or design of a business. Having a differentiated (and hard-to-differentiate) yet effective and efficient ‘strategic architecture’ to an enterprise’s business model is important. Both Dell Inc. and Wal-Mart have demonstrated the value associated with their business models (Webvan and many others demonstrated just the opposite). Both Dell Inc.’s and their business models were different, superior, and hard for competitors to replicate. They have also constantly adjusted and improved their processes over time.¹⁶

One might be tempted to argue that designing, implementing, and validating a business models is straightforward, but this simply is isn’t so. Aspects of designing (and/or redesigning) a business model are undoubtedly readily routinized and codified. Note the plethora of taking note of the numerous business books providing instruction on how to write a business plan. Such manuals can provide some discipline to the business model questions that one should ask. However, designing a new business requires creativity, insight, and a good deal of customer, competitor, and supplier information and intelligence. There is a significant tacit component. Entrepreneurs and executives are forced to make many informed guesses about customer and competitor behavior, as well as the behavior of costs. Indeed, a validating a business model and a business plan requires both effort and judgment. It takes requires detailed fact-specific inquiry including: Conducting a keen understanding of customer research to understand customer needs and their willingness to pay; an understanding of procurement cycles and the sales cycle; knowledge of supply and distribution costs; and an understanding of competitor positioning news and likely competitive responses. Put differently, selecting the right ‘architecture’ for a business requires an not just about understanding of the choices available; it also requires assembling the evidence needed to validate conjectures and hunches about costs, customers, competitors, complementors, distributors, and suppliers.

Designing good business models is in part an ‘art.’ However, the chances of success are greater if enterprises: (1) analyze multiple alternatives, (2) have a deep understanding of user needs, (3) analyze the value chain thoroughly so as to understand just how to deliver what the customer wants in a cost-effective and timely fashion; and (4) adopt a neutrality or relative efficiency perspective to outsourcing decisions. Useful tools include market research and transaction cost economics. Chesbrough and Rosenbloom (2002) suggest that established enterprises often have blinders

¹⁵ Let us take another example to consider. A rock star might decide to use concerts as the key revenue generator, or the concert may be primarily to stimulate a concert to boost sales of recordings. The star could decide to spend less time performing at concerts, and more time in the recording studio. There is clearly a choice of various media to extract value: live productions, live performances, movies, sale of CDs through stores, online sales of music through virtual stores such as the iTunes Store offered by Apple, etc. The emergence MASS internet, of the Internet, Napster, and Napzee stores like iTunes have in turn required artists and the (and record companies) to rethink their business models. The ability to reconfigure a business models for delivering and pricing the music industry profitably is undoubtedly a dynamic capability for both the record companies and the artists themselves.
¹⁶ Indeed, a critical fact element of a Dell’s success is not just that the way it has organized the value chain organization, but also that the products it decides which products to sell through its distribution system. The initial products were personal computers initially, but now include printers, and now include digital projectors, and computer-related electronics.

with respect to alternative business models—and that this prevails even if the technology is spun off into a separate organization, where other (path-dependent) constraints are less likely to exist.

In short, designing the business correctly, and figuring out what John Seeley Brown refers to as the ‘architecture of the revenues’¹⁷ (and costs), involve processes critical to the formation and success of new and existing businesses. No amount of good governance and leadership is likely to lead to success if the wrong business model is in place. Good business models achieve advantageous cost structures and generate value propositions acceptable to customers. They will enable innovators to capture a large enough portion of the value created to ensure profitability.

### Complementary Assets and Cospecialization
In the context of competition and competitive advantage, it is common to stress that various innovations are substitutes, rather than complements that may be cospecialized to each other. Indeed, Schumpeter (1934) stressed that successful innovations/enterprises are threatened by swarms of imitators, all striving to produce ‘me-too’ substitutes.²² He completely neglected complementarities.

However, complementary innovation and complementary assets are of great significance, particularly in industries in which innovation might be characterized as cumulative, and/or where industry ‘platforms’ exist or are needed. Examples of complementary innovation are ubiquitous. In the enterprise software industry, business applications can be especially valuable to users if they can be integrated into a single program, or into a tightly integrated suite. The development of gyroscopic stabilizers made imaging devices such as video cameras and binoculars easier to use by minimizing the impact of camera shake, and enhanced the product, especially when the new feature was able to be introduced at low cost. Likewise, better high-energy rechargeable batteries enable laptop computers and cell phones to operate for longer times. Situations of complementarities where there is also cospecialization between technologies, and between technologies and other parts of the value chain, are common, yet remain poorly analyzed in economic analysis and in strategy formulation.

²² Schumpeter wrote (1934: 223) that innovations/new combinations carried out by entrepreneurs ‘are not, as one would expect according to general principles of probability, evenly distributed through time ... but appear, if at all, discontinuously in groups or swarms.’ This ‘swarming’ of innovations and innovative activity occurs ‘excessive because the appearance of one or a few entrepreneurs facilitates the appearance of others, and these the appearance of more, in ever increasing number’ (Schumpeter, 1934: 228). Recent studies that analyze patent races have also reinforced the view that innovations are substitutes, not complements.

Cospecialized assets are a particular class of complementary assets where the value of an asset is a function of its use in conjunction with other particular assets.²⁵ With cospecialization, joint use is value-enhancing.²⁴ Cospecialization results in ‘thin’ markets; i.e., the assets in question are idiosyncratic and cannot be readily bought or sold in a market. Capturing cospecialization benefits may require integrated operations (Teece, 1980). Cospecialization allows differentiated product offerings or unique cost savings. The inherent ‘thin’ market environment surrounding proprietary assets means that competitors are not able to rapidly assemble the same assets by acquisition, and hence cannot offer the same products/services at competing price points.

Management’s ability to identify, develop, and utilize in combination specialized and cospecialized assets built or bought is an important dynamic capability, but it is not always present in enterprise settings. Special value can be created (and potentially appropriated by another party) through asset combinations, particularly when an asset owner is not cognizant of the value of its assets to another party that owns assets whose value will be enhanced through combination.²⁵ This arises because the markets for cospecialized assets are necessarily thin or nonexistent. Langlois (1992) highlights the case of the diesel-electric locomotive where, in the 1920s, Charles Kettering had developed advanced lightweight diesel technology at the GM labs. The earliest use was in submarines. Alfred P. Sloan, GM’s chairman, saw the possibility of applying the technology to make diesel-electric locomotives—steam power was, at the time, completely dominant. To accomplish this, GM needed capabilities resident in the locomotive manufacturers and at Westinghouse Electric. Langlois (1992: 115) notes that the three sets of capabilities might have been combined by some kind of contract or joint venture, but the steam manufacturers—Alco, Baldwin, and Lima—failed to cooperate.²⁶ In short, both innovation and reconfiguration may necessitate cospecialized assets being combined by management in order for (systemic) innovation²⁷ to proceed. Managers do not always succeed in doing so, sometimes because they do not sense the need or the opportunity, and sometimes because they do but they are unable to effectuate the integration. If the assets cannot be procured externally, they will need to be built internally.

The ability of management to identify needs and opportunities to ‘invest’ in cospecialized assets (through its own development or astute purchase) is fundamental to dynamic capabilities. Mere ‘horse-trading’ skills (which market agents possess) will not suffice to build sustainable competitive advantage, and decisions on when and how to invest—whether to build or buy cospecialized assets—will depend upon many factors, including transaction costs. In particular, it will depend on management’s entrepreneurial capacities with respect to matching up and integrating relevant cospecialized assets.

It is apparent that cospecialization involves ‘lock-in’ and is a particular form of complementarity that exists when technologies and other assets need to be part of a tightly integrated system to achieve the performance that customers want. Business success in such circumstances requires the coordination of R&D investment and alliance activity. The manner and timing with which such coordination needs to be accomplished is important to success (Teece, 1986; Mitchell, 1991). The presence of common ownership facilitates system-wide innovation and economic performance (Teece, 2000) and protects against opportunism (Williamson, 1975).

²³ Lippman’s and Rumelt’s (2003a, 2003b) recent work on developing the microfoundations for resource-based theory is very complementary to my development of the microfoundations of dynamic capabilities. I acknowledge their efforts in modeling cospecialized and complementary assets. In particular, they use the concept of supermodularity to bring in the tools of cooperative game theory. The idea of supermodularity was introduced by Donald Topkins as a way to formalize complementarity, and is also used by economists such as Milgrom and Roberts (see, in particular, Milgrom and Roberts, 1990) and evolutionary game theorists to model (strategic) complementarities (for instance, in models of R&D spillovers).
²⁴ Complete cospecialization is a special case of economies of scope where not only are complementary assets more valuable in joint use than in separate use, but they have zero value in separate use and high value in joint use. Cospecialization may stem from economies of scope, but they could also stem from the revenue enhancement associated with producing a bundled or integrated solution for the customer.
²⁵ Even if they are cognizant, they do not have the bargaining power to take advantage of the situation.
²⁶ This was not because the companies feared holdup in the face of highly specific assets. Rather, it was because they actively denied the desirability of the diesel and fought its introduction at every step. GM was forced to create its own capabilities in locomotive manufacturing.

To summarize, entrepreneurs and managers can create special value by combining cospecialized assets inside the enterprise (Teece, 2007). This may require investments to create the necessary cospecialized technologies—as illustrated by Thomas Edison and the creation of electric power as a system. It is not uncommon in technology-based industries to find that certain technologies are worth more to some market participants than to others, based on the technology they already have, and their technology and product strategy.

### Learning, Knowledge Management, and Corporate Governance
With intangible assets being critical to enterprise success, the governance and incentive structures designed to enable learning and the generation of new knowledge become salient. There are many types of learning—including experiential, vicarious, individual, and organizational—and a large literature that explores each type. Also ‘sensing’ requires learning about the environment and about new technological capabilities. R&D was seen as one way that the enterprise could promote such learning. However, in the context of the dynamic capability discussed in this section, the ability to integrate and combine assets including knowledge is a core skill (Kogut and Zander, 1992; Grant, 1996). The combination of know-how within the enterprise, and between the enterprise and organizations external to it (e.g., other enterprises, universities), is important.

Integrating know-how from outside as well as within the enterprise is especially important to success when ‘systems’ and ‘networks’ are present. Good incentive design and the creation of learning, knowledge-sharing, and knowledge-integrating procedures are likely to be critical to business performance, and a key (micro)foundation of dynamic capabilities (Nonaka and Takeuchi, 1995; Chesbrough, 2003). Of equal importance are monitoring and managing the ‘leakage,’ misappropriation, and misuse of know-how, trade secrets, and other intellectual property. Of course, tacit know-how is difficult to imitate and has a certain amount of ‘natural’ protection. However, much know-how does leak out. Innovating business enterprises with limited experience have been known to inadvertently compromise or lose their intellectual property rights. Failure to proactively monitor and protect know-how and intellectual property is common.

The outsourcing of production and the proliferation of joint development activities likewise create requirements that enterprises develop governance procedures to monitor the transfer of technology and intellectual property. Technology transfer activities, which hitherto took place inside the enterprise, increasingly take place across enterprise boundaries. The development of governance mechanisms to assist the flow of technology while protecting intellectual property rights from misappropriation and misuse are foundational to dynamic capabilities in many sectors today. Figure 3 summarizes the microfoundations of this third class of dynamic capability.

There are also several other ‘governance’ issues relevant to dynamic capabilities. At one level there are governance and business model issues associated with an enterprise’s ability to achieve asset ‘combinations’ and reconfiguration. As noted earlier, there is a continuous need to modify product offerings, business models, enterprise boundaries, and organizational structures. Decentralized structures that facilitate near decomposability are likely to assist in achieving reconfiguration.

One class of governance issues relates to incentive alignment. The microfoundations of incentive issues are embedded in an understanding of agency and incentive design issues, also discussed earlier. Agency theory has long emphasized that the separation of ownership from control creates interest alignment problems, particularly around management compensation and the allocation of corporate perquisites. The abuse of discretion and the use of corporate assets for private purposes can occur absent appropriate accountability/oversight. These issues become more severe as an enterprise grows and the separation between ownership and management widens. Recent corporate governance scandals in the United States, Europe, and Japan indicate the need for continued vigilance. However, increasing the mix of independent and ‘inside’ directors will not necessarily ameliorate problems associated with strategic ‘malfeasance.’

There are likely to be benefits associated with participation at the board level by individuals who can calibrate whether the top management team

**Figure 3.** Combination, reconfiguration, and asset protection skills

is sufficiently ‘dynamic.’ The replacement of the CEO and other members of the top management team, if they demonstrate weak sensing, seizing, and reconfiguration capabilities (strategic ‘malfeasance’), is important to effectuate. That is not to say that guarding against financial malfeasance is unimportant. It will always remain an important corporate governance function; but its significance is likely to pale next to strategic ‘malfeasance,’ which is harder to detect Integrate and evaluate. To assess the current wave of governance reforms in the United States—with its strong emphasis on accounting controls and systems integrity—may inadvertently lead to a much bigger ‘strategic’ performance failures by management. Boards stacked with inexperienced ‘independent’ board members may not have the requisite talents to properly diagnose strategic ‘malfeasance’ and respond accordingly.

A related literature in economics has stressed how poorly designed incentives can produce tensions between the actions of employees and the actions needed to achieve profitable performance. Dysfunctional behavior, such as activity that generates influence costs, has received considerable attention (Teece, 2003). Also, through use of collective bargaining, employees in industries insulated from global competition have been able to appropriate economic surplus. Above-market wages—which characterized wages—which, for example, characterized and to some extent still characterize certain enterprises in the auto industry, steel industry, steel, and airline industries in the United States—are a case in point. These conditions can extend to managerial ranks as well. Restructuring may then require the judicious use of bankruptcy laws to rewrite uncompetitive supply contracts that are the product of unrealistic collective bargaining actions in an earlier period. The ability of some enterprises to craft work specifications that, attract and retain more committed talent, design reward systems, develop corporate cultures, and develop that blunt the formation of coalitions that extract quasi-rents through threatening to withhold participation, is an important managerial capability.

The design and creation of mechanisms inside the enterprise to prevent the dissipation of rents by interest groups (both management and employees) would also appear to be very relevant to dynamic capabilities, but has not been high on the agenda of strategy researchers to. One exception is Gottschalg, an exception is Gottschalg and Zollo (2007), who point out that the capacity to continuously achieve incentive alignment is an important performance-enhancing (and rent-protecting) dynamic capability.

Many of the issues discussed here have, in the past, that fallen under the rubric of human resource management; a closer integration of these issues with the strategic management issues would appear to be warranted. The reason is related to strategic management is that strategic focus focuses not only on how to generate rent streams, but also on how to prevent them from being dissipated or captured by capture or dissipation by various entities or groups inside and outside the enterprise of the enterprise. For instance, the example, the concepts such as of the ‘appropriability regime’ and ‘isolating mechanisms’ were developed by strategic management scholars to help explain how to protect and guard against the dissipation of rents from innovation and other sources of superior performance can be protected and guarded不易被模仿的对手 from competitors and others by competitors. However, the earlier focus had been primarily on markets or ‘external’ competition, and did not address internal appropriation by interest groups inside the enterprise.

## DYNAMIC CAPACITY

### Opportunities for ‘ORCHESTRATION’ Skills, AND COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE

The general framework advanced here sees dynamic capabilities as the foundation of enterprise-level competitive advantage in regimes that enable rapid technological change. The framework suggests indicates that the extent to which an enterprise develops and employs superior (nonimitable) business models that will determine the nature and amount of intangible economic profits that the enterprise can earn profits it will create and/or assemble and the level. This framework also emphasizes that the past will impact current and future performance. However, there is much that management can do to simultaneously design processes and structures that support to facilitate innovation while unshackling the enterprise from the shackles of dysfunctional processes and structures that were designed for an earlier period in the past.

In Teece and Pisano’s (1994) and Teece’s et al.’s (1997), we proposed that three organizational 감사 processes—coordination/integrating, learning, and reconfiguring—as were identified as the core elements of dynamic capabilities for the enterprise. These processes are considered a subset of the processes that support sensing, seizing opportunities, and managing threats. Together, they might be thought of as asset ‘orchestration’ processes. A key strategic role function of management is to find new value-enhancing combinations inside within the enterprise itself, as well as between and amongst enterprises, and with other supporting institutions external to the enterprise. Because many of the most valuable assets inside a firm an enterprise are knowledge-based related—thus and hence nontradable—the coordination and integration of these assets create value that cannot be easily replicated in a marketplace. This establishes a unique distinctive role for managers in economic theory and in the broader economic system of the economy. Managers seek to align cospecialized assets to create new combinations (Teece, 2007). The need to sense opportunities and seize opportunities, as well as to reconfigure the business when change occurs, requires the allocation and reallocation of, combination, and recombination of resources and assets to be managed. These activities are central to the strategic function role of executives in strategic management. Indeed, the skills required used to identify and exploit complementarities and manage cospecialization are scarce—skills that are scarce. Figuring out how to increase the value from the use of the assets owned by the enterprise involves requires knowing the detailed fine-grained structure of the firm’s asset base and addressing filling in any the gaps that may be necessary to provide superior customer solutions for the enterprise. Gap-filling to fill these gaps may involve building new capabilities assets, or through acquisitions, or forming strategic partnerships with other entities (Ettlie et al. and Pavlou, 2006).

The dynamic capabilities approach recognizes that a business enterprise is both shaped by and not necessarily constrained trapped by its historical past. Management can make significant differences through strategic investment choices and other strategic decisions decisions. Enterprises can also have the ability to shape their own ecosystem ecosystems. In this regard, the framework aligns with a Chandlerian perspective is quite Chandlerian (Chandler, 1990a, 1990b), where. Managers have considerable potential to set influence technological and market trajectories, particularly in the early stages early on in the development of a market (David, 1992). Indeed, enterprises and their environments often frequently coevolve, allowing for mutual influence. However, given because the context of rapid technological change exposed to intense global competition and the full force of international competition—there is little room for significant errors big mistakes.

Hence, the dynamic capabilities framework presented here is partially aligned but not entirely in the spirit with the spirit of evolutionary theorizing in economics. The framework aims endeavors to capture identify the critical key variables and their relationships that need to be ‘manipulated’ to create, safeguard, protect, and leverage intangible assets to achieve superior so as to ensure sustainable enterprise performance and avoid the zero-profit trap. However, the process of building a and assembling tangible and intangible assets and implementing effectuating change is recognized as inherently difficult. Long-term success is likely to depend on requires achieving necessary internal creative disruption destruction, which may involve including activities such as spin-outs and spin-offs to sustain achieve superior performance over time. Additionally, decision-making biases must also be actively neutralized to ensure effective decision-making. In essence, enterprises may bear more resemble resemblance to biological entities organisms than some economic economists, business leaders, managers, and strategy scholars might are willing to admit; yet, they are also more adaptable malleable than some organizational theorists ecologists might be are willing to acknowledge recognize. 

The enterprise must will need dynamic capabilities, encompassing sensing capabilities, seizing opportunities, and transformational/reconfiguring capabilities, to be developed and applied concurrently to be dynamic simultaneously to build and sustain competitive advantage over time. Simultaneity may not be necessary at the individual product level—indeed, as Helfat and Peteraf note (2003), there is a distinction between capability development and subsequent refinement. Attempting to achieve sensing, seizing, and reconfiguring simultaneously at the product level could result in chaos and inefficiency lack of effectiveness, as organizational routines and procedures rules in the organization would likely be in constant flux.

The first two capabilities identified as fundamental—sensing and seizing—are related to, but distinct different from, March’s (1991, 1996, 2006) concepts of exploration and exploitation. March argues seems that both exploration and exploitation are essential necessary for organizational adaptation, but he acknowledges highlights the inherent tensions, if not outright incompatibilities, between the two activities them. His reasoning is partly that exploration and exploitation compete for scarce resources, and that the mindsets and organizational routines required for exploration one are markedly different from those needed for exploitation, making their simultaneous pursuit challenging difficult, if not impossible, to achieve (March, 1996: 280). While there is validity merit to each of these assumptions, they need contextual perspective to be put into perspective. Regarding With respect to competition for resources, sensing activities do does not necessarily involve large resource commitments of resources, at least not compared relative to the resources required for seizing activities. For example, certain aspects, such as monitoring the environment, can be relatively low-cost activities activity. Early-stage exploratory research is also typically inexpensive relatively low-cost inexpensive. Mansfield’s studies et al.’s (1971: Table 6.2) studies of new product development research showed that the costs of early-stage research activities were only a small fraction percentage of the total costs of new product development costs. For instance, the cost of pharmaceutical development costs typically far exceed those of pharmaceutical discovery costs. Furthermore, with respect to the differing mindsets and routines required, while tensions undoubtedly exist, these can be alleviated by assigning different organizational units (or different parts sections of an organizational unit) to specialize to some degree on sensing versus focusing on seizing activities. As Gupta notes, ‘exploration or exploitation in one domain may coexist with high levels of exploration or exploitation in another domain’ (Gupta, Smith, and Shalley, 2006: 697). Additionally, outsourcing manufacturing or supply chain functions and other aspects of seizing activities can reconcile these issues even more starkly, as the operational routines needed for proficient manufacturing are then externalized to external entities lie external to the firm.

The necessity need for both exploration and exploitation is widely accepted and well-accepted in the literature and is embedded in the concept literature of adaptive systems, particularly in discussions on organizational ambidexterity for (example e.g., O’Reilly & and Tushman, 2007). This body of literature acknowledges recognizes that exploration and exploitation can be supported by differentiated organizational structures but partially or weakly integrated subunits (such as divisions or, departments). Sensing activities should ideally need to be decentralized to capture local insights, with the gathered information flowing upward rolling up to senior top management for synthesis. In contrast, seizing activities typically involve tight planning and execution will be a key part of seizing, whereas but less emphasis is placed on tight planning is less critical for sensing activities.

To summarize, an enterprise’s ability to effectively manage threats and to reconfigure itself is contingent dependent upon its investment activities activity, which in turn is fundamentally dependent on its capacity to sense opportunities an opportunity. This aspect of dynamic capabilities underscores indicates that the likelihood of achieving financial success hinges depends on a sequence of events and the enterprise’s responses to them. Formally, let the probability of achieving a high level of economic profitability profits ranking for an enterprise, conditional upon on some extraordinary event occurring—such as an exogenous technological change E (e.g., an exogenous technological change that opens up the possibility of a new business opportunity—such as a technological shift)—be occurring, be denoted as Pt1P_t(Ππ|EE). Then, the probability can be expressed as:  
Pt1(π|E)=Pt(sense1|E)×Pt(seize|E,sense)×Pt(manage threats/transform|E,sense,seize)×Pt(π|E,sense,seize,manage threats/transform)P_t(Π|E)=P_t(sense|E)×P_t(seize|E,sense)×P_t(manage threats/transform|E,sense,seize)×P_t(Π|E,sense,seize,manage threats/transform).

As emphasized throughout this paper and in earlier treatments by this author, it is also imperative necessary to evaluate assess the issue of the ‘sustainability’ or nonimitability of both assets and capabilities. This sustainability in turn depends upon a variety of factors, encapsulated summarized by the twin concepts such as of ‘isolating mechanisms mechanism’ and ‘appropriability regimes.’ When the appropriability regime is robust ‘tight’ and the enterprise’s business enterprise’s own isolating mechanisms are strong, differential performance can be sustained for a period, at least for a time. Dynamic capabilities, however, require the ongoing creation, integration, and commercialization of a continuous stream of innovations consistent with customer demands needs and technological opportunities, ensuring alignment with market demands.

Note that within the dynamic capabilities framework, enterprises must leverage sensing, seizing, and reconfiguring mechanisms to allocate direct their financial resources in alignment with market needs and business imperatives. However, as a matter of pure theory, enterprises are not need not to continuously reinvent themselves unnecessarily. The necessity need to reinvent depends on external events and market dynamics, anticipated or otherwise. If the ecosystem in which the enterprise operates is embedded remains relatively stable, the need for reinvention to change can be reduced accordingly.³⁰ For example, Indeed, if an enterprise controls key industry standards or can effectively stabilize its own competitive environment in some way, it may not be required to engage in the continuous costly and disruptive exploration of radical alternatives (March, 1991). By selecting appropriate business models, making strategic investment decisions, and pursuing incremental innovations, an enterprise can remain highly competitive for a decade or more—for example, so (e.g., Boeing’s decision to develop build the 747, which, thirty years later, still generates significant economic returns).³¹ However, in fast-paced environments characterized by rapid technological change and global competition, continuous adaptation and reinvention are often necessary to sustain competitive advantage.

The dynamic capabilities framework emphasizes that enterprises must not only respond to external changes but also proactively shape their ecosystems. This involves entrepreneurial and managerial actions that go beyond mere adaptation, such as creating new markets, setting industry standards, or building strategic alliances. The ability to orchestrate assets—both tangible and intangible—within and across enterprise boundaries is central to achieving and sustaining superior performance. This orchestration requires a deep understanding of the enterprise’s asset base, the ecosystem’s dynamics, and the interplay of complementary and cospecialized assets.

### MANAGERIAL AND ENTREPRENEURIAL ROLES IN DYNAMIC CAPABILITIES
The dynamic capabilities framework places significant emphasis on the role of managers and entrepreneurs. Unlike traditional economic models that often assume passive or optimizing agents, this framework recognizes managers as active orchestrators who make strategic choices under uncertainty. Their ability to sense opportunities, seize them through astute investment decisions, and reconfigure the enterprise’s asset base is critical to long-term success. These roles require a blend of analytical skills, creative insight, and practical wisdom.

#### Sensing Opportunities
Managers and entrepreneurs must continuously scan the environment for technological, market, and competitive developments. This involves not only accessing information but also interpreting it to identify actionable opportunities. The framework highlights the importance of organizational processes that support sensing, such as R&D, market research, and open innovation practices. These processes reduce reliance on individual cognitive abilities and embed sensing capabilities within the enterprise.

#### Seizing Opportunities
Seizing opportunities requires making informed investment decisions, selecting appropriate business models, and aligning resources to capture value. Managers must navigate uncertainties, such as competing technological trajectories or shifting customer preferences, and commit resources to the most promising paths. The framework underscores the importance of overcoming decision-making biases, such as risk aversion or program persistence, that can hinder innovation. It also emphasizes the need for business models that align with the enterprise’s technological and market strategies.

#### Reconfiguring Assets
Reconfiguration involves adapting the enterprise’s asset base and organizational structure to maintain competitiveness. This may include integrating new technologies, divesting obsolete assets, or restructuring business units. The framework highlights the role of governance mechanisms, incentive alignment, and knowledge management in facilitating reconfiguration. Managers must balance the need for stability with the imperative for change, ensuring that the enterprise remains agile without descending into chaos.

### THE ROLE OF THE BUSINESS ECOSYSTEM
The dynamic capabilities framework departs from traditional industry-based analyses, such as Porter’s Five Forces, by focusing on the business ecosystem. The ecosystem includes not only competitors and customers but also complementors, suppliers, regulatory bodies, standard-setting organizations, and research institutions. This broader perspective recognizes that innovation often requires collaboration across organizational boundaries and that competitive advantage depends on the enterprise’s ability to shape and leverage ecosystem dynamics.

For example, in platform industries, success depends on building and sustaining a network of complementors that enhance the platform’s value. Enterprises like Apple and Microsoft have demonstrated the power of ecosystem orchestration by fostering developer communities that create complementary products and services. Similarly, in industries characterized by systemic innovation, enterprises must coordinate with suppliers and partners to integrate cospecialized assets effectively.

### CHALLENGES AND LIMITATIONS
While the dynamic capabilities framework offers a robust approach to understanding enterprise performance, it is not without challenges. Developing and deploying dynamic capabilities is inherently difficult due to their tacit nature, path dependencies, and the complexity of orchestrating intangible assets. Enterprises may struggle to overcome entrenched routines, bureaucratic inertia, or misaligned incentives that hinder adaptation. Moreover, the framework’s emphasis on managerial agency assumes that leaders possess the requisite skills and foresight, which may not always be the case.

Another challenge is the context-specific nature of dynamic capabilities. What constitutes a dynamic capability in one industry or ecosystem may not be relevant in another. For example, the sensing capabilities needed in high-technology sectors differ from those in more stable industries like utilities. Enterprises must tailor their capabilities to their specific competitive environment, which requires a deep understanding of local conditions and dynamics.

Finally, the framework’s focus on nonimitability and appropriability raises questions about sustainability. While strong isolating mechanisms and tight appropriability regimes can protect competitive advantage, they are not foolproof. Competitors may eventually replicate or circumvent capabilities, especially in environments with rapid knowledge diffusion. Enterprises must therefore continuously renew their capabilities to stay ahead.

### IMPLICATIONS FOR SCHOLARS AND MANAGERS
For scholars, the dynamic capabilities framework provides a lens to explore the microfoundations of competitive advantage. It integrates insights from strategy, innovation, organizational theory, and entrepreneurship, offering a multidisciplinary approach to understanding enterprise performance. Future research could focus on empirically testing the framework’s propositions, particularly the interplay of sensing, seizing, and reconfiguring capabilities. Studies could also explore how dynamic capabilities evolve over time and how they vary across industries and institutional contexts.

For managers, the framework offers practical guidance for navigating complex and dynamic environments. It emphasizes the importance of building organizational processes that support sensing, seizing, and reconfiguring, rather than relying solely on individual talent. Managers should prioritize investments in R&D, market intelligence, and open innovation to enhance sensing capabilities. They should also develop decision-making processes that mitigate biases and support strategic investments in cospecialized assets. Finally, managers must foster a culture of adaptability, ensuring that the enterprise can reconfigure its assets and structures in response to changing conditions.

### CONCLUSION
The dynamic capabilities framework advanced in this paper provides a comprehensive approach to understanding the foundations of enterprise success in dynamic, globally competitive environments. By focusing on the capacities to sense, seize, and reconfigure, the framework highlights the critical role of managerial and entrepreneurial orchestration in creating and sustaining competitive advantage. It recognizes the importance of intangible assets, cospecialization, and ecosystem dynamics in driving long-run performance.

While the framework is not a prescriptive model, it offers a set of principles and variables that scholars and managers can use to analyze and enhance enterprise performance. It underscores the need for continuous adaptation, strategic investment, and ecosystem orchestration in regimes of rapid technological change. By embedding dynamic capabilities within organizational processes and governance structures, enterprises can better navigate uncertainty, capture value from innovation, and avoid the zero-profit trap associated with perfect competition.

The framework also challenges traditional strategy paradigms, such as Porter’s Five Forces, by emphasizing the endogenous nature of market structures and the proactive role of enterprises in shaping their environments. It aligns with evolutionary and Schumpeterian perspectives on economic change, recognizing that innovation and entrepreneurship are central to competitive advantage. Ultimately, the dynamic capabilities framework offers a path forward for enterprises seeking to thrive in an increasingly complex and interconnected global economy.
