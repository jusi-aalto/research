## Abstract

This paper discusses two opposing narratives of digitalization. Both these narratives are found in existing literature, and the paper understands them as the utopic and dystopic narratives of digitalization. The former expresses unbridled enthusiasm about the bright side of digitalization, while the latter is predominantly pessimistic, and primarily focuses on the undesirable aspects of digitalization. Observing that scholars tend to subscribe to either one or the other narrative, this paper proposes a more middle ground where these competing narratives can be balanced to usher in a better digital future.

## Introduction and Objective

We are being irreversibly shaped by the continuous digital transformation that pervades all aspects of businesses and society (Majchrzak et al., 2016) and there is "increasing recognition of the interconnected and overflowing nature of the digital world" (Burton-Jones et al., 2021). Digital transformation refers to the "profound changes taking place in society and industries through the use of digital technologies" (Vial, 2019, p. 118) and is triggering changes to structures, processes, and even the overall evolution of organizations and societies (Markus and Rowe, 2021). In fact, some scholars have argued that, instead of being influenced by reality, digital technologies are often the ones that are creating it, leading to what has been called an "ontological reversal" (Baskerville et al., 2020, p. 509).

Digitalization is helping advancement by offering "the possibility of transforming activities and redefining existing roles, work boundaries, and authority in ways that go to the core of a work practice" (Pachidi et al., 2020, p. 19). It has been argued that important facets of digital transformation, such as digital platforms, are central to create societal and business value (Bonina et al., 2021). Benefits of digital transformation range from "game changing opportunities" for the private sector (Sebastian et al., 2017, p. 197) to improved service and efficiency in the public sector (Gong et al., 2020).

In the process, digital transformation is redefining the workplace and offering new modalities of capability development to drive organizational innovation (Baptista et al., 2020). Digital transformation has been connected to the augmentation of human intelligence – through offerings such as artificial intelligence and deep learning – to address pressing issues such as cybersecurity, healthcare, and terrorism (Jain et al., 2018). Emerging areas of research and practice, based upon increasing digitalization – such as Fintech – have been argued to be salient to "making the world a better place" (Lagna and Ravishankar, 2022, p. 61), leading to outcomes such as financial empowerment (Senyo et al., 2023).

However, some scholars are increasingly expressing concerns about the negative effects of rampant digitalization, observing that the "intensified ubiquity of digital technologies are spawning a phenomenon that is messy, complex, and chaotic", thereby ushering in a new set of challenges for the digital age (El Sawy et al., 2010, p. 835). For example, with the emergence of Big Data Analytics, and with datafication becoming an integral aspect of digitalization movement, the collection and leveraging of large amounts of data to feed computationally intensive analytical techniques is now routine (Grover et al., 2020). This raises ethical concerns related to human vulnerability being potentially exacerbated or exploited (Benbya et al., 2021).

Again, researchers have expressed concern that algorithms embedded in digital artifacts, especially those based upon machine learning, are prone to systematic biases and often eschew human fairness (Dolata et al., 2022). On a similar note, it has been argued that universally-recognized human values – such as privacy, security, equality, integrity, and transparency (Abbasi et al., 2016) – are often challenged in the digital age, leading to undesired outcomes where humans lose control of their own data, and suffer consequences as a result (Barocas and Nissenbaum, 2014).

It is notable that these narratives, one emphasizing a singularly optimistic view of digitalization and the other expressing an overly pessimistic view of digitalization, are often forwarded by mutually exclusive groups of scholars. That is, scholars who believe in the benefits of digitalization seem to completely eschew the possible dangers related to the negative ramifications of digitalization. Similarly, the scholarly group that is deviled by the negative implications of digitalization mostly refuse to see the substantial benefits that digitalization has brought about.

**Reacting to these polarizing opinions, the primary objective of this paper is to discuss the salient ramifications of digitalization and better understand the challenge it can pose to human values and well-being.** We elaborate upon the above two competing narratives that are emerging in the digitalization literature: one which venerates digitalization by considering that it is ushering in a state of digital utopia; and the other, where digitalization is increasingly being viewed with the fear of leading us toward digital dystopia. We believe there is some truth to both narratives, but we also feel that academics and practitioners should be simultaneously aware of, and act on, both these narratives. Therefore, one prominent aim of this paper is to elaborate on digital utopia and digital dystopia as reflected in the discussions on digitalization and digital transformation, and propose some pathways where we can balance these two narratives for a better digital future.

## The Fundamental Underpinnings of Digitalization

Arguably, digitalization can be understood in terms of three salient aspects: **hyperconnectivity** due to unprecedented technology infusion; **datafication/robotification**; and **platformization**.

### Hyperconnectivity

Hyperconnectivity amongst digital technology elements that are infused into a process, is a fundamental attribute of digitalization and many digital transformation initiatives. The basic idea behind hyperconnectivity is three-fold:

1. To digitally connect objects, processes, machines, and people
2. Apply algorithms to govern the abovementioned connections
3. Leverage Big Data to inform processes that govern the design and implementation of these algorithms (Calvo, 2020)

Hyperconnectivity has enabled us to "transition to a socio-technical milieu in which a very high proportion of the population uses communication and computer technology that provides continuous access to other people, media, knowledge, devices and a wealth of computer services" (Gaines, 2019, p. 7). Partly enabled by the Internet of Things (IoT) revolution, where information and communication technologies are embedded in physical objects (such as refrigerators, washing machines, and automobiles) for collecting and exchanging data for analyzing real-time user behavior (Yang et al., 2021), hyperconnectivity has become a defining aspect of contemporary life.

### Datafication/Robotification

An immediate implication of the hyperconnectivity is the increasing **datafication** of society and businesses. There is a general belief that – supported by the hyperconnectivity and the enabling of data collection and analyses – bigger and better data are substantial drivers to organizing and managing contemporary businesses and society as well as key to economic development (Kelly and Noonan, 2017). Datafication is propelled by the objective of tracking and quantifying social behavior, using digital technologies (Cukier and Mayer-Schoenberger, 2013). In fact, authors have noted an ideological belief in this objective, calling it "dataism" (Van Dijck, 2014).

It is widely regarded that collecting copious amounts of data and slicing/dicing/manipulating it as needed is fundamental to reveal new insights about human behavior and opportunities to do business (Mikalsen and Monteiro, 2021). As a consequence, there is an increasing trend to use digital devices to track and monitor human behaviors and decision-making to better "know" the end-user, presumably with an intent to provide greater value through this knowledge (Newell and Marabelli, 2015).

On a related note, the tendency to rely on algorithmic decision-making (which underpins the trends of hyperconnectivity and datafication) has prompted extensive **robotification** of contemporary society (Nørskov, 2022). The use of robots is increasingly becoming pervasive – from self-driving cars, to vacuum cleaners, to intelligent agents, to healthcare assistants – leading to what has been called as "ubiquitous social roboting" (Fortunati, 2016, p. 3).

Interestingly, robotification does not necessarily imply only physical (mechanical) robots performing stipulated tasks, and can go beyond it. For example:
- Business processes are increasingly being roboticized for better automation and customizability (Lacity and Willcocks, 2016)
- Augmentation of human intellect (Lebovitz et al., 2022)
- Robotic agents are being used for varied purposes such as financial fraud management, delivery of food and drugs, and attending to human emotions and offering psychological support (Benbya et al., 2021)

### Platformization

Digital platforms are fundamental to the modern economy, providing idiosyncratic capabilities (Li and Kettinger, 2021) that help sustain innovative ecosystems (Jacobides et al., 2018). Such platforms are typically sociotechnical creations that are driven by needs such as automation and efficiency, reach and range, and information (Grover and Lyytinen, 2022). They offer a set of specialized digital resources that can enable value-creating interactions between external parties such as producers and consumers (Constantinides et al., 2018).

**Platformization** is becoming pervasive in today's digital world where "Big Tech" companies such as Microsoft, Google, Apple, and Amazon are leveraging their established digital platforms to develop and reinforce their core business value – thus creating what is commonly becoming known as the "platform economy" (Hodapp et al., 2022, p. 115). Such platforms are increasingly decentered and driven by the network effects of their stakeholders (Clough and Wu, 2022; Gregory et al., 2021). Notably, the decentralized nature of these platforms may allow stakeholders to interact in ways that are inconsistent with the intentions of the original platform designers, thereby creating ethical challenges in platform governance (Bonina et al., 2021).

## The Dominant Narrative of Digital Utopia

Proponents of the value of digital transformation often highlight the multiple benefits that digital transformation ushers in due to the fundamental advantages of hyperconnectivity, datafication, and platformization. They argue that digital transformation has given rise to never-before-seen benefits, such as:

- The rise of new and innovative digital services (Soto Setzke et al., 2021)
- Ability to discover new knowledge through the use of digital assets (Verhoef et al., 2021)
- Design and implementation of smart work processes (Yang et al., 2021)
- Evidence-based decision-making (Shrestha et al., 2019)
- Augmentation of human capabilities (Jain et al., 2021)
- Improving equity and sustainability and the ultimate creation of a welfare state (Busemeyer et al., 2022; Senyo et al., 2023)

Digital utopia enthusiasts argue for the value of data as a strategic resource – **"data as the new oil"** (Couldry and Yu, 2018, p. 4473) being a common expression – heralding a new area of corporate science (Hartmann and Henkel, 2020). It has also been observed that the digitalization has ushered in dramatic value creation in markets, redefined the scope of the firm and afforded possibilities of reinvention, created new avenues for capturing business value through creation and delivery of new products and services, and unquestionably changed organizational structures for better learning and creativity (Lanzolla et al., 2020).

### Societal Benefits

From a societal perspective, digital transformation has been argued to inform new perspectives on addressing societal issues such as:
- Healthcare
- Environmental sustainability
- Human rights
- Economic upliftment (Majchrzak et al., 2016)

For example, digitalization has been shown to be a driver of:
- Poverty alleviation (Jha et al., 2016)
- Human well-being (Ganju et al., 2016)
- Addressing education and social marginalization (Parthiban et al., 2020)

Undoubtedly, digitalization has had multiple benefits. However, as with anything else, the transformational changes ushered by digitalization are a double-edged sword where they induce not only positive outcomes, but also generate multiple harmful consequences – indeed, "there is a growing, fractious tension between our technological capabilities and the human social structures within which the technologies reside" (Mikalef et al., 2022, p. 257). Therefore, the discourse on digitalization includes a distinct dystopic narrative as well, one which necessitates serious consideration.

---

## The Alternate Narrative of Digital Dystopia

Beyond the optimism surrounding the narrative of digital utopia, there is also an increasing concern that corporations and society, fueled by the tenets of digitalization we discussed above, are becoming greedy, instrumental, and unemotional (Gleasure and Feller, 2016). The advancement of information technology seems to have added to this problem, with researchers observing that "there is no evidence that digital technologies, or the experiences they engender, are making us a wiser or happier society" (Calvo and Peters, 2012, p. 28).

### Dehumanizing Practices

A substantial problem is that businesses are often increasingly leveraging the digital movement for **oppressive** (Kane et al., 2021) and **dehumanizing** purposes (Moore and Piwek, 2017), where digital technologies such as wearable and self-tracking devices (WSTTs) attempt to quantify human body and emotions (Lupton, 2013) so as to render them exploitable for corporate profits - in the process, forcing human beings into an instrumental and masculinized paradigm (Moore and Robinson, 2016).

Other examples of such dehumanized outcomes are:
- **Technostress** (Srivastava et al., 2015)
- **Problematic use of social media** (Turel and Qahri-Saremi, 2016) including cyberbullying (Lowry et al., 2016)
- **Loss of work-life balance** due to technological intrusion (Sarker et al., 2013)

### Digital Surveillance

There is growing pessimism about increasing **digital surveillance** (Blackman, 2020). Organizations are promoting the use of AI technologies to increase surveillance of their employees, apparently with an objective to improve workplace safety (Chamorro-Premuzic, 2020). Panoptical surveillance increased manifold during the COVID-19 pandemic, due to employees working remotely – ultimately raising serious concerns regarding individual rights to privacy (Faraj et al., 2021).

### Discrimination and Loss of Accountability

Likewise, another emerging concern is the increasing affront to human dignity in the face of **discrimination induced by digital technologies**. It has been well-documented how organizations are implementing algorithms (embedded in digital technologies) that are biased against racial minorities (Noble, 2018). It is also concerning that overreliance on algorithmic decision-making is creating **lost accountability**, with algorithmic opacity (Gal et al., 2020) allowing human beings to be absolved of immediate culpability (Busuioc, 2021).

Human values are being challenged and subjugated by digital artifacts (Demetis and Lee, 2018; Schuetz and Venkatesh, 2020), resulting in decreased human voice and autonomy. Digital technologies are also vulnerable to being misappropriated for devious acts, such as:
- Online sexual exploitation and human trafficking (Demetis and Kietzmann, 2021)
- With personal data being increasingly digitized and accessible (Leidner and Tona, 2021), individuals of all ages are often exposed to vulnerabilities like:
  - Invasion of privacy
  - Loss of data security
  - Cyberbullying (Turel et al., 2021)

### The Dark Side of Digitalization

Clearly, the rapid digitalization of businesses and society have created a parallel narrative on the **"dark side"** of digitalization, where human values are being challenged, reinterpreted, marginalized, and exploited (Verbeke and Hutzschenreuter, 2021). Academics have expressed concern that "we currently go about designing [and using] new technologies without any sense of how our… decisions will impact…[human] psychological health and flourishing" (Calvo and Peters, 2014, p. 7). This is often a result of "a legacy of [digitally-enabled] industry discomfort with certain aspects of humanness" and consequently, technological progress has proven ineffective for the increased well-being of an individual or collective (Calvo and Peters, 2014, p. 3, emphasis added).

## Addressing the Tension Between the Two Narratives

Our discussion above clearly highlights the two alternate narratives of digitalization, and our position of accepting opposing digitalization narratives is supported by recent observations in the literature (Sabherwal and Grover, 2024). The more dominant perspective extolls the values of digital transformation, with increased datafication, treating data as the "new oil" to be extracted – ultimately believing that better quantification of humans is fundamentally beneficial (Crawford, 2021). The opposite, cautious perspective showcases how unbridled enthusiasm with digital transformation and subscribing to an increasingly data-centric worldview (termed as "informania") leads to subversion of human interests, values, and ultimately the quality of human life (Kane et al., 2021).

Given the chasm between these two narratives and the scholarly groups that subscribe to each narrative, we feel the two competing narratives call for some efforts to address the tension between them. Such efforts can help multiple stakeholders compromise, agree, and converge on the digitalization movement, creating better and consistent future outcomes.

## Current Strategies in the Face of the Competing Narratives

Regrettably, current approaches to addressing this tension often fall short in our opinion. Such strategies take the form of what can be termed as **avoidance or domination** (Ashforth et al., 2014). This means that proponents of digital utopia either tend to turn a blind eye (avoid) the dystopic outcomes or tend to forcefully dominate away those outcomes. Proponents of digital dystopia tend to do the opposite.

### Avoidance Strategies

Proponents of digital utopia have often argued that the dystopic outcomes are a **necessary evil** that we need to accept in exchange for the benefits we reap from digital transformation. They argue that we can avoid concerns regarding digital dystopia if we concentrate primarily on the benefits that digital transformation brings. There is also a tendency to underestimate the dystopic outcomes, claiming them to be often small or insignificant compared to the benefits.

An opinion that often seems to be held (by proponents of digital utopia) is that the dystopic outcomes were not willful; they merely happened as an unintended consequence of digitalization. There is also an added tendency to latch on to the **utilitarian argument**, that while digitalization affects some people negatively, it affects far more individuals in a more positive fashion. In fact, even if dystopic outcomes are recognized, corporations are often being held culpable for strategies of avoidance. These include:

- **"Ethics shopping"** (changing ethical principles for retrofitting prior actions)
- **"Ethics bluewashing"** (treating ethical matters superficially or deceptively)
- Exploiting gaps in digital ethics
- Moving seemingly unethical practices to regions with weaker ethical and legal regulations (termed as **"ethics dumping"**) (Floridi, 2019, p. 186)

### Domination Strategies

On the other side of the fence, proponents of digital dystopia seem to concentrate primarily on the dark side of digitalization and eschew discussions of the benefits of digitalization. For example, scholars have expressed concern that digital technologies are luring us into being trapped by "Faustian Bargains" from which there may be no respite (Ngwenyama et al., 2023). It has also been feared that "autocratic regimes, democratic majorities, private platforms, and religious or professional organizations can achieve social control by managing the flow of information [aided by digital technologies] about individuals' behavior" (Tirole, 2021, p. 2007), thus compromising human freedom.

Scholarly work in the dystopic tradition has placed singular focus on the harmful consequences of digitalization – such as digital discrimination (Weidmann et al., 2016) or digital addiction (Allcott et al., 2022) which seem to erode the very ethos that sustains our societies.

|---|---|
| **Utopic** | **Dystopic** | **Strategies Currently being Employed** | **A Proposed (better) Holistic Strategy for a Digital Tomorrow** |
| **Empowering** | **Oppressive** | **Avoidance** (mainly practiced by the dystopic school) | **Practice digital mindfulness (responsibility) and embrace the digital paradox** |
| A case study of two remote Chinese villages reveals how digitalization helped empower the villages communities which were previously marginalized and helped develop a "rural e-commerce ecosystem" promoting self-development for the erstwhile marginalized communities. (Leong et al., 2016, p. 475) | The widespread use of data collection via ubiquitous devices and implementation of machine learning helps corporate giants wield substantial control over users (Kane et al., 2021); this has been termed as "surveillance capitalism" (Zuboff, 2019) | The dystopic narrative tries to eschew the liberating aspect of digitalization | The utopic narrative tries to dominate the concerns for oppression (case specifics) |
| **Transformational** | **Dysfunctional** | **Domination** (mainly practiced by the utopic school) | **Conversion of vicious digitalization cycles into virtuous digitalization cycles** |
| Digitalization is transforming all aspects of society and businesses. For example, in the public sector digitalization is fundamentally altering the public sector in terms of smarter and personalized government services, redefining government functions, and shaping city and community infrastructure (Benbunan-Fich et al., 2020) | Excessive dependence upon algorithmic intelligence and datafication results in dysfunctional societal outcomes such as misinformation, discrimination, lost opportunities, bias, and racial stereotyping (Marabelli et al., 2021; Markus, 2017; Martin, 2019) | The dystopic narrative is silent on the transformational potential of digitalization, and emphasizes the dysfunctional aspects of disruption | The utopic narrative promotes the transformational value of digitalization as the primary consideration |
| **An emphasis on the utilitarian value of digitalization** | **An emphasis on the deontological challenge to digitalization** |  | **Employ moral pragmatism to guide design and implementation of digital systems** |
| Digital technologies help businesses make substantial improvements, such as better customer service experience, operational streamlining, and the development of new business models (Singh and Hess, 2017) | Data digitalization poses challenges to human dignity, where humans lose intrinsic value and instead become subservient to digital technology and "artifacts of technology production" (Leidner and Tona, 2021, p. 343) | The dystopic narrative focuses primarily on the encroachment upon human values through digitalization | The utopic narrative cites the utilitarian aspect of digitalization as being the only consideration |

## Strategies to Address the Tension Between the Two Narratives

The existing ways of addressing the tension between the two narratives are unsatisfactory and myopic. We believe that, instead of avoidance or domination, perhaps the best way forward is to strive for some sort of a **balancing act** between the two narratives. A balancing approach has been forwarded to better understand the impacts of digitalization (Sabherwal and Grover, 2024), and we build upon this perspective to offer some thoughts on how we can retain the benefits of digital utopia while addressing the possible dystopic outcomes of digitalization.

In effect, this balancing should take a **holistic approach** which "involves the complete, simultaneous, and typically conscious acceptance of both opposing orientations" (Ashforth et al., 2014, p. 1465).

For a holistic strategy, it is helpful to first characterize the two narratives using pairs of dichotomous terms. For purposes of illustration, we discuss the tensions between the two narratives in the form of: **empowering-oppressive**, **transformational-dysfunctional**, and **utilitarian-deontological** and propose some ideas that can help balance them.

### Balancing Empowerment and Oppression: Practice Digital Mindfulness (Responsibility) and Embrace the Digital Paradox

One strategy to address the tension between empowerment and oppression in the context of digitalization is to practice what can be termed as **mindfulness** (Ashforth et al., 2014). The idea of mindfulness can be extended to a digital terrain, where organizations implementing digital technologies focus on the current state of digital implementation, clearly evaluate operational details, and are open-minded to consider alternate digital perspectives and options (Thatcher et al., 2018).

Generally, mindfulness has three components:
1. **The creation of new categories of meaning**
2. **Openness to new information**
3. **An implicit awareness of multiple perspectives** (Fiol et al., 2009, p. 44)

In our context, this thus implies that new meanings should be imparted to digitalization, such as new concepts that can bridge empowerment and oppression. One possible concept is to explicitly recognize the **paradoxes inherent in digitalization** (Gebauer et al., 2020), which can produce both positive and negative outcomes – such as empowerment or oppression – in a contingent manner. That is, the same digital technologies could become oppressive in one context and empowering in another context.

To prevent oppressive outcomes, the first step would be to **identify the contingencies** that promote the respective outcomes of empowerment and oppression. This would lead to better management of the contingencies (such as through training, education, resource allocation, etc.) to ensure that digitalization has a consistently positive effect.

#### Practical Implementation

Stakeholders involved in digital strategy should also be open to new information and accordingly recalibrate their digitalization efforts. For example, a digitalization approach may have been rolled out, but continuous monitoring of the impacts of the digitalization effort should be implemented. This monitoring would bring in additional information that may help tone down or accelerate the digitalization process.

For example, let us say a state completely digitalizes a welfare program. Upon subsequent monitoring, it is found that this implementation has created techno-anxiety among senior citizens. In that case, the state may scale down its digitalization efforts and offer more degrees of freedom where the welfare program can also be availed of in-person. In other words, a good balancing act would be to have an alternate channel that can achieve the same outcomes as those envisioned initially through digitalization.

Finally, digital strategy stakeholders may use multiple perspectives to leverage the dichotomy and look for opportunities to convert oppression into empowerment. This goes back to idea of looking for and managing contingencies of digitalization where – by paying attention to the contingencies – oppressive implications can be converted to empowering ones. For example, if a certain city has an elderly population who are technologically challenged, and thus feel a prisoner to the digitalization wave, the state may implement digital help at the doorstep, where education/guidance/support would be provided for the senior citizens to combat their anxiety and leverage digitalization as a tool of empowerment.

#### Digital Responsibility

A similar idea to digital mindfulness, namely **digital responsibility** (see the special issue call in the Journal of the Association for Information Systems), could also be drawn upon to understand and reconcile the two competing narratives. Digital responsibility allows us to "embark upon rigorously analyzing, explaining, predicting, as well as influencing, the potential costs, duties, and obligations of decisions that relate to the development, implementation, and use of digital information and communication technologies."

Digital responsibility is a salient construct, with ethical, social, and ecological implications. In a sense, digital responsibility allows us to practice mindfulness across varying levels of digitalization – individual and collective – to create a better digitalization experience, more consistent with the utopic understanding of digitalization.

### Balancing the Transformational and Dysfunctional Nature of Digitalization: Convert Vicious to Virtuous Cycles

The transformational perspective of digitalization proposes that digitalization is a **virtuous cycle**, consisting of better transformations of businesses and society, leading to more digital advancement and even better digitalization. The dysfunctional perspective of digitalization proposes digitalization as causing rapidly negative implications, spiraling into even more negativity with progressively increasing digitalization. Is there a way to break the former vicious cycle and convert it to a virtuous cycle?

Pradies et al. (2021) propose three possible ways to convert a vicious cycle to a virtuous cycle:

1. **"Breaking dysfunctional dynamics"**
2. **"Facilitating new responses"**
3. **"Embedding virtuous dynamics in the organization"** (p. 1248)

#### Practical Example: Addressing Algorithmic Bias

From a digitalization perspective, breaking dysfunctional dynamics would imply immediate observation and identification of the problems that are causing the vicious cycle. For example, an organization can realize that an implemented machine learning algorithm has promoted racial bias and marginalization. How would the organization attempt to break the vicious cycle?

**Step 1: Breaking Dysfunctional Dynamics**
- Make a willful attempt to change the algorithm
- Identify problematic sources of data, where the data in question could have inherent biases (e.g., data about only a subset of the population, or data that portrays a certain section of the population in a negative light)

**Step 2: Facilitating New Responses**
- Issue a call for responses from individuals who may have been affected by the bias and racial discrimination
- Invite them to voice their concerns and engage them in a dialogue to understand how their values were compromised
- This exercise will lead to an identification of the values that the machine learning algorithm sidestepped and make these values a prominent part of the discourse toward revising the algorithm
- Revisit any data collected that could have resulted in the bias, and commission more pervasive data collection as a form of a new response addressing the bias

**Step 3: Embedding Virtuous Dynamics**
- Following the notion of **value sensitive design** (Friedman et al., 2017), the organization could implement a revised version of the algorithm that now embeds the values which were compromised earlier
- This would likely convert the vicious cycle into a virtuous one

### Balancing the Utilitarian and Deontological Perspectives of Digitalization: Employ Moral Pragmatism Using a Multi-Perspective Approach

In most cases, the utopic perspective of digitalization leverages the **utilitarian argument** that it causes most gain for most people, and we should consider that aspect and accept the benefits of digitalization. In contrast, the dystopic perspective of digitalization mostly operates from a **deontological standpoint**, where digitalization is purported to negatively affect rights and values that individuals hold dear. For example, proponents of the dystopic view argue that digitalization negatively affects the deontological rights to privacy and autonomy.

The deontological and utilitarian perspectives are two of the three dominant ethical perspectives, with **virtue ethics** being the third (Chatterjee and Sarker, 2013).

#### Moral Pragmatism

This tension between the deontological and utilitarian perspectives can be somewhat resolved by employing what we term as **moral pragmatism**, which is "a concept in which the ethical theory used by a decision maker varies in different circumstances based on their moral reasoning" (Draščk et al., 2021, p. 814). This approach can be valuable in a digital world where the complex nature of ethical issues presents decisional challenges where no definitive ethical standard can be universally applied (Sabherwal and Grover, 2024).

Moral pragmatism provides some respite to this challenge, by recognizing the interdependence between ethical perspectives and allowing pragmatism to guide ethical choices, contingent upon the issues at hand (Draščk et al., 2021). Moral pragmatism allows us to acknowledge that engaging in ethical understanding based on only one normative framework can be limiting (Rosenthal and Buchholz, 2007), and thereby advocates some form of **moral pluralism** which acknowledges that diverse ethical perspectives can coexist, but should be invoked judiciously and justifiably (Gal et al., 2022).

#### Multi-Perspective Approach

One way to employ moral pragmatism is to employ some kind of a **hierarchical structure of ethical perspectives** where different ethical theories are invoked at varying stages of the design and implementation of digital artifacts (Seeamber and Badea, 2023). For example, starting with the virtue perspective to allow human "exemplars" to have a predominant stake in the design and implementation process, the deontological and utilitarian perspectives could then be invoked at appropriate stages for further refinement of the design and implementation of technologies.

This approach advocates the careful application of ethical theories to varying aspects of design and implementation, so as to build a multi-perspective ethical framework for analyzing different issues related to digital artifacts and their development (Gal et al., 2022). Employing a multi-perspective approach can allow us to address blind spots in a particular ethical perspective, thereby developing a holistic (and appropriate) ethical understanding.

## Looking Forward: Implications of the Reconciliation for the IS Scholarly Community

We believe that our strategies of reconciliation, though preliminary, have implications for varying forms of IS research, such as **behavioral research**, **design science research**, **analytics research**, and **policy research and analysis**.

### Behavioral Research

For scholars embedded in the behavioral tradition, the key idea to be understood is how human behavior can be mindful, responsible, and ethically ambidextrous in a digital world. From a quantitative standpoint, it would thus be important to understand what organizational, technological, and individual factors promote/encourage such ethicality, responsibility, and mindfulness. For qualitative researchers, it would be interesting to understand the processual mechanisms by which such mindfulness and ethicality can emerge and how digital artifacts interplay with human beings, affording or constraining such mindful behavior. A prime issue of investigation for qualitative researchers could be processual elements that can convert vicious digital cycles to virtuous ones.

### Design Science Research

For scholars pursuing design science research, it would be valuable to understand how to embed human values in digital artifacts that can then promote such balanced and mindful behavior. The key would be to design methods, tools, and techniques that inherently promote a balanced digital view. Design science researchers can therefore design such responsible and ethically defensible artifacts, which can then help behavioral researchers investigate positive human interplay with such ethically responsible artifacts.

### Analytics Research

Analytics researchers who investigate areas related to artificial intelligence and machine learning, can focus applying analytical tools to better understand insights generated from the data and whether these insights showcase a balanced digital view or are skewed toward a particular narrative. For example, data analytic techniques and applications that become tools of discrimination or oppression should be identified and revised, possibly in consultation with behavioral and design science researchers. This cross-pollination and collective effort between analytics, design science, and behavioral researchers would result in better analytical tools crucial to human empowerment, as well as economic progress.

### Policy Research

Policy-oriented scholars and practitioners can focus on digitalization laws and policies at the organizational, national, or international levels and understand how to design and implement regulatory guidelines that are better tuned to the complexities of the digital age. Policy makers often grapple with substantial ambiguity in understanding the nature and ramifications of digital transformations of organizations and society (Chen and King, 2022). A clear engagement with balancing the utopic and dystopic narratives of digitalization can help resolve some of this ambiguity (through an intense reflection on the respective narratives), and help formulate policies that can inculcate a smoother and more beneficial approach to digitalization.

## Conclusion

To conclude, in this paper, we have identified the key tenets of digitalization, highlighted the two competing narratives of digitalization, and discussed their implications. To enable digitalization efforts that contribute to an economic and instrumental value while not leading to a dysfunctional society, we urge colleagues to engage with both the narratives, and seek to balance them, even if such balancing would initially seem to be challenging and imperfect.

We put forward some ideas of possible balancing in that regard, which can hopefully inspire digitalization scholars and practitioners to move forward and work toward creating a better digital tomorrow. We are encouraged that our ideas find resonance in contemporary IS consciousness, and hope to see more academic and practitioner efforts geared toward fostering a better digital future.
