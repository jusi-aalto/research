**ABSTRACT**  
In this article we provide a systematic review of the extensive yet diverse and fragmented literature on digital transformation (DT), with the goal of clarifying boundary conditions to investigate the phenomenon from the perspective of organizational change. On the basis of 279 articles, we provide a multi-dimensional framework synthesizing what is known about DT and discern two important thematical patterns: DT is moving firms to malleable organizational designs that enable continuous adaptation, and this move is embedded in and driven by digital business ecosystems. From these two patterns, we derive four perspectives on the phenomenon of DT: technology impact, compartmentalized adaptation, systemic shift and holistic co-evolution. Linking our findings and interpretations to existing work, we find that the nature of DT is only partially covered by conventional frameworks on organizational change. On the basis of this analysis, we derive a research agenda and provide managerial implications for strategy and organizational change.

**INTRODUCTION**  
Digital transformation (DT) is increasingly establishing itself as a constant theme in contemporary academic and practitioner conversations. A quick search in Google Trends shows that interest skyrocketed from a level of 1 to 100 in the six years between 2013 and 2019. This comes alongside a surge of published articles, conference panels and special issues in academic journals. Furthermore, as to its strategic importance (Singh et al., 2020), it has become taken for granted that DT is affecting and challenging managers across industries and contexts (e.g., Andriole, 2017; Benner and Waldfogel, 2020; Correani et al., 2020; Westerman et al., 2014). The challenges around the COVID-19 pandemic have further spurred organizations into action by increasing their awareness of the need to accelerate DT (e.g., McKinsey, 2020; strategy&, 2020).

The extensive and diverse literature on DT, however, suffers from a lacking common agreement on exactly what DT is (Warner and Wäger, 2019), and what it encompasses (Wessel et al., 2020). Systematic reviews or meta-analyses are rare and narrowly focused (e.g., Schallmo et al., 2017), or come from outside of the field of management (e.g., Vial, 2019). Despite this lack of clarity surrounding the phenomenon, a common theme in the current debate is that due to the proliferation of digital technologies defined as the combination and connectivity of innumerable, dispersed information, communication and computing technologies (Bharadwaj et al., 2013) – contemporary organizations are both affected and need to adapt (e.g., Correani et al., 2020; Verhoef et al., 2019; Weill and Woerner, 2018). Therefore, the phenomenon is naturally connected to the topic of organizational change, viewed as a ‘difference in form, quality, or state over time in an organizational entity’ (Van de Ven and Poole, 1995, p. 512). Thus, we define DT as organizational change that is triggered and shaped by the widespread diffusion of digital technologies. Such a view enables us to potentially explain the phenomenon of DT and its management in business practice by drawing on the robust and diversified knowledge base relating to organizational change and innovation (Poole and Van de Ven, 2004).

At the same time, however, the phenomenon of DT also seems to present an opportunity (and necessity) to advance the existing body of knowledge about organizational change. While prior research studied organizational change in relation to information technology (IT) (Markus and Robey, 1988; Orlikowski, 2000; Volkoff et al., 2007), the latter defined as ‘computer-based technology for the storage, accessing, processing and communication of information’ (Molloy and Schwenk, 1995, p. 283), and created valuable and persistent knowledge, recent observations suggest that DT deviates from these past organizational changes in at least the following ways. First, the technologies involved, such as big data analytics, social media, mobile technology or cloud computing, seem very different from earlier IT (Bharadwaj et al., 2013). Unlike more traditional enterprise systems, they exhibit new properties: they are seen as generative, malleable and combinatorial (Kallinikos et al., 2013). Accordingly, assumptions about material characteristics and their consequences for organizations (e.g., Boudreau and Robey, 2005) may no longer hold. Second, many digital technologies cannot be restricted to the boundaries of specific firms or industries but involve a wider ecosystem and the demand-side. The overarching digital infrastructures that are emerging are open, flexible and ready for use by anyone, not just by companies (Tilson et al., 2010). Thus, the focus of many past studies on change within an organization, e.g., in relation to the adoption and use of enterprise IT systems (e.g., Volkoff et al., 2007), seems insufficient. Third, the consequences of DT – such as the emergence of new digital business models even in non-digital industries – seem to extend beyond those of previous phases of IT-enabled change, which were usually related to the practice level and rather incremental change within firms (e.g., Orlikowski, 2000). In summary and as indicated by recent works (e.g., Wessel et al., 2020), it seems that the phenomenon of DT differs from past IT-related organizational change and cannot, therefore, be explained entirely using established theoretical models (Markus and Rowe, 2018). Instead, DT seems to have a more intricate and encompassing connection to the topic of organizational change, requiring a broader view of and comparison with the literature on organizational change and innovation (Poole and Van de Ven, 2004).

Due to the uncertainties about the phenomenon, it is currently unclear whether, and if so how knowledge on organizational change can be used to explain DT. In other words, as the boundaries of the phenomenon are unclear, we cannot be sure whether DT is covered by existing knowledge of organizational change. Boundary conditions ‘place limitations on the propositions generated from a theoretical model’ (Whetten, 1989, p. 492). When the empirical reality is changing, for instance due to the emergence of a new phenomenon, the fit with established theoretical models might be altered (Busse et al., 2017). From this perspective, in order to utilize and advance existing knowledge, we need to assess the fit between DT and the established theoretical models in the field of organizational change. Therefore, the following questions become pertinent: How can knowledge about DT be synthesized? What are the characteristics of DT? And, how does DT relate to existing knowledge on organizational change? Finding answers to these questions is important as it would enable a common academic understanding, a precondition for better building on each other’s work and mitigating the risk of riding fashion waves or applying false analogies. Furthermore, linking DT to extant knowledge on organizational change would enable us to give more informed guidance on successfully managing DT in business practice (Andriole, 2017), particularly regarding strategy and organizational change. Accordingly, we aim to clarify the boundary conditions both phenomenologically and inductively (Post et al., 2020). As demonstrated by several role models that have followed this procedure for other topics and delivered substantial contributions to theory in management literature (e.g., Crossan and Apaydin, 2010; Whiteman et al., 2013), one way to achieve this is via a literature review (Post et al., 2020).

For this study, we conducted a systematic review of the existing literature using a sample of 279 peer-reviewed articles. We identified key areas of inquiry and emerging themes, and synthesized the findings into a multi-dimensional framework comprising contextual conditions, mechanisms and outcomes of DT to ‘bring together all parts of the proverbial elephant’ (Crossan and Apaydin, 2010). From this basis, we derived two aggregated thematic patterns concerning the content of change: first, we found that DT leads to a shift towards malleable organizational designs which enable continuous adaptation. Second, this shift is embedded in and driven by digital business ecosystems. By connecting these content patterns with the dimensions of context and process (Pettigrew, 1987), we derived four perspectives on DT: technology impact, compartmentalized adaptation, systemic shift and holistic co-evolution. Next, we discuss the derived thematic patterns and the typology in relation to established theoretical accounts in the literature on organizational change and innovation. Among the multiple schools of thought in the literature (Poole, 2004), the dynamics of change seem to be key to understanding DT. Thus, we relate our findings particularly to the distinction in organizational change literature between episodic and continuous change perspectives, as this distinction is ‘sufficiently pervasive in recent work and sufficiently central in the conceptualization of change’ (Weick and Quinn, 1999, p. 362). Whereas the episodic position relates to infrequent and intentional organizational change (Lewin, 1951; Poole and Van de Ven, 2004; Waeger and Weber, 2019), the continuous position assumes ‘ongoing, evolving and cumulative’ change (Weick and Quinn, 1999, p. 365). We evaluate the fit between the underlying assumptions of that dichotomy and the phenomenon of DT. Finally, we derive a substantial research agenda on the basis of our analysis of the fit between the phenomenon of DT and the established literature on organizational change and innovation.

While there are multiple ways in which a literature review can make a theoretical contribution, this article aims to contribute via the clarification of boundary conditions, which is seen as critical for the advancement of research around a theory or topic (Post et al., 2020). In particular, our work contributes in the following ways. First, we provide the most comprehensive and up-to-date review of DT from a management perspective, synthesizing and integrating the current state of knowledge into a comprehensive and connective framework, and deriving two thematic patterns that describe the overarching peculiarities of DT. Second, we distil a typology comprising four perspectives on DT that helps to reduce the complexity of the phenomenon by offering structure and clarity. Third, we propose linkages between the phenomenon of DT and established views in management literature on organizational change and innovation and derive important avenues for future research. Overall, our review aims to help scholars to understand the phenomenon DT, encourage them to think differently about the phenomenon, and allow the development of novel and interesting empirical studies in subsequent research (Post et al., 2020). Finally, our work aims to support managers to respond to the strategic challenge of DT (Singh et al., 2020) by revealing important insights on the shifts towards malleable organizational designs and digital business ecosystems that may inform organizational change and strategy practices.

### RESEARCH DESIGN
We chose the systematic review (Tranfield et al., 2003) as the methodology for our study and proceeded in three steps: (1) data collection, (2) data analysis, and (3) synthesis (Crossan and Apaydin, 2010). We limited our sources to peer-reviewed journals, as these tend to have high impacts in the field (Podsakoff et al., 2005). We selected the year 2000 as the baseline for our search in order to gain robust insights into recent developments in the understanding of DT. Our initial search was performed in the EBSCO Business Source Complete (BSC) database. We chose this database because it allows researchers access to the full-text content of more than 1,300 peer-reviewed journals in the fields of management and economics (e.g., *Academy of Management Journal* or *Management Science*). It is thus one of the most complete sources of business studies (González-Benito et al., 2013; Zott et al., 2011) commonly used in literature reviews (e.g., Certo et al., 2009; Laplume et al., 2008). The search within the BSC database was performed using the following keywords: ‘digital transformation’ and ‘digital’ AND ‘transformation’. These keywords resulted in a sample of 416 articles. We next performed a backward-forward search by (1) reviewing the references of the articles that we had identified in the initial search, and (2) identifying articles that cited the articles in our initial sample (cf. Webster and Watson, 2002). This resulted in a further 453 articles, leading to a total of 869 articles.

We then distilled the most relevant papers by filtering them into three groups (see Crossan and Apaydin, 2010). Articles that were published in one of the 50 journals in the Financial Times list (FT50) were allocated to Group 1. The FT50 list contains high quality journals across a range of disciplines, such as the *Journal of Management Studies* or *Organization Science*, and was used as a representative and externally valid sample of top management journals (Biehl et al., 2006; Burgess and Shaw, 2010). This criterion was chosen based on the premise that top journals normally publish high quality papers and has also been applied in other literature review studies (e.g., Crossan and Apaydin, 2010; Kwak and Anbari, 2009). This returned a total of 46 articles. Articles that met our citation-based selection criteria and that were not published in one of the FT50 journals were allocated to Group 2. The 124 articles we assigned to this group had at least 20 citations in the BSC database or in Google Scholar. Finally, to consider citation biases and time lags we placed any recent publications (2016–18) that were not published in one of the FT 50 journals and had fewer than 20 citations in the BSC database or in Google Scholar into Group 3. 109 articles were assigned to this group. This filtering process left us with a total of 279 articles across the three groups.

Our analysis followed the structuring content analysis approach of Mayring (2000, 2014). We chose this approach because it allows the systematic and theory-guided reduction of a large amount of text data from any type of communication down to its essence by classifying the material into unifying categories, and also because it is a well-known and established analysis process (e.g., Breitenmoser and Bader, 2016; Engert and Baumgartner, 2016; Fastenrath and Braun, 2018). For this approach, Mayring (2000, 2014) advises carrying out the following five steps: (1) develop a category system according to the research questions, (2) code relevant passages in the text in accordance with the category system, (3) revise the previously developed classification framework, (4) code the text according to the revised category system, and (5) interpret and discuss the final results. Accordingly, we first deductively derived the basic structuring dimensions from the literature. More specifically, we adopted Pawson and Tilley’s (1997) generic contextual conditions–mechanisms–outcome structure, which allowed us to analyse our collected data without preconceptions or prior assumptions. We selected this structure for three specific reasons. First, as is explained in more detail later on, it allowed us to cater to all four of the dimensions of organizational change, or ‘issues common to all change efforts’ (p. 293), named by Armenakis and Bedeian (1999), i.e., content, context, process and outcomes (see explanation below). Second, this approach has been applied multiple times in case studies in the context of DT and digital innovation (e.g., Henfridsson and Bygstad, 2013; Huang et al., 2017). For instance, Henfridsson and Yoo (2013) used it to describe trajectory shifts of automotive incumbents entering the era of digital innovation. Third, the structure is generic enough to scope out the field (Crossan and Apaydin, 2010) and serve as a foundation for analysing the broad and diverse literature on DT. The rather simplistic categories of the framework are building blocks that allow complex analysis and interpretation of the findings (see discussion section). Thus, the initial categories were contextual conditions, mechanisms and outcomes, representing the issues of context, process and outcomes (see Armenakis and Bedeian, 1999). To also cater to the issue of content (see Armenakis and Bedeian, 1999), we subsequently distilled the key findings and constructs from each article (Mayring, 2014) that provided the material for further analysis and allocated them to the categories.

**A. Hanelt et al.**

In order to illustrate the categories, we provide some exemplary findings in the following. An example of contextual conditions is the emergence and diffusion of cloud computing, as it is described as shaping and driving DT (e.g., Benlian et al., 2018). In the category mechanisms we identified, for example, process models to describe and explain how small and medium enterprises drive DT in their companies (Li et al., 2017). Finally, the description of the novel institutional building blocks and infrastructures that emerge through DT can be seen as an exemplary insight regarding the outcomes of the phenomenon (e.g., Hinings et al., 2018).

After conducting a trial run-through comprising about 10 per cent of the material, we refined the initial category system by subdividing the existing categories (Mayring, 2014). For instance, the category contextual conditions was divided into the sub-categories of material, organizational and environmental antecedents. After applying the categories and sub-categories to about half the material, we again revised the category system by splitting up the sub-categories ‘into individual features or values’ (Mayring, 2014, p. 95). For example, environmental antecedents were found to contain country characteristics, industry characteristics and consumer characteristics. Thus, the divisions at the lowest level of the hierarchical category system reflect very specific key areas of inquiry. Eventually, we categorized all of the material according to the final category system. This process was performed following an iterative procedure of re-examining the articles and discussion, which allowed us to achieve agreement among all authors (see Karhunen et al., 2018). First, two authors performed the allocations independently. Then the same authors cross-checked each other’s results and discussed any discrepancies. If, for example, discrepancies were just based on misunderstandings, the allocations were unified immediately. In a next step, the allocations were scrutinized by two other authors in isolation. Finally, the prevailing discrepancies were discussed and unified by all four authors until agreements were reached on the allocations of all the articles. After the final category system was derived, in order to make the analysis more meaningful and actionable, the authors allocated labels to each key area. Based on a review of the factors within the key areas, the authors first developed labels individually and then compared, discussed and decided on them collectively. These labels refer to the key themes in the respective key area, indicating the particular direction of change. For example, in the key area ‘product’ we found that ‘smart, connected and customizable products’ was a suitable theme. In the following section, we describe the findings of our review in detail.

### FINDINGS
As Figure 1 illustrates, the rise in interest in DT has been fast and recent. The number of publications dealing with DT has risen substantially over time. Indeed, 50 per cent of the 279 articles in the consideration set were published in the last five years. Figure 1 shows the cumulative number of articles on DT published between 2000 and 2018 within our sample.

**Figure 2.** Multi-dimensional framework of digital transformation

In the following, we synthesize the findings of our review into both a research matrix (Appendix I, II and III) and a comprehensive, multi-dimensional framework of DT (Figure 2). The matrices organize our findings and link together the review’s different insights into a coherent whole, while the multi-dimensional framework condenses the matrices into an overarching structure and provides a practical tool for scholars and practitioners to analyse DT. The matrices comprise the three aforementioned categories – contextual conditions, mechanisms and outcomes. In the following we consecutively describe each category, its respective sub-categories, and the key themes of each sub-category. The sub-categories and key themes are illustrated in *italics* (e.g., *organizational strategy and legacy*, part of the sub-category organizational determinants).

#### Contextual Conditions
Contextual conditions define the onset of DT (Henfridsson and Yoo, 2013). Our review found *material, organizational and environmental antecedents* which trigger and shape DT (see Wessel et al., 2020).

Clearly, the emergence and diffusion of a variety of digital technologies and applications have triggered and shaped DT as *material antecedents*. We found that so-called SMACIT technologies (social, mobile, analytics, cloud, and Internet of Things) (e.g., Sebastian et al., 2017) especially shape DT due to their specific characteristics, referred to as digital properties, most importantly their reprogrammability, homogenization of data, and self-referential nature (Yoo, 2010). Concurrently, the emergence and diffusion of digital technologies has led to an *increased data availability*, which in turn has increased the importance for organizations of machine learning and data analytics (Weichert, 2017).

When digital technologies enter organizations, they interact with *organizational antecedents* particularly *organizational and managerial characteristics*. *Organizational characteristics* encompass *organizational strategy and legacy*, such as the historical pathway of an organization (e.g., Devadoss and Pan, 2007), as well as an organization’s resources, processes, values and culture (e.g., Dewan et al., 2003). *Managerial characteristics*, on the other hand, rely on the *digital transformation awareness of TMT* to initiate DT. This can, for example, be expressed by a positive attitude towards change and technology (e.g., Dery et al., 2017).

Obviously, material and organizational antecedents are embedded in and interact with *environmental antecedents* – particularly *country characteristics, industry characteristics and consumer characteristics*. These include the legal and infrastructural conditions of a country, such as regulatory frameworks and interventions (e.g., Cortet et al., 2016), but also *technology-driven industry dynamics*, including, among other things, the changing technological landscape of an industry (e.g., Alos-Simo et al., 2017). Furthermore, *consumer characteristics*, particularly *digital consumer demand*, shape DT. Consumers increasingly rely on digital technologies in their daily routines and personal interactions (e.g., Brynjolfsson et al., 2013), and expect ubiquitous access to virtual resources (e.g., Benlian et al., 2018).

#### Mechanisms
Following Hedström and Swedberg (1998), input and output variables are in general linked via mechanisms. We identified two main mechanisms used by organizations to conceive and bring about DT: *innovation* and *integration* (Daniel and Wilson, 2003; Henfridsson and Yoo, 2013). Mechanisms of *innovation* involve the application of resources, processes and capabilities that are new to the organization, while *integration* includes the alignment of these with existing resources, processes and capabilities (Ranganathan et al., 2003).

For *innovation mechanisms*, we found that DT involves novelty in both strategic and operational regards. For instance, *developing a digital business strategy* is a key activity linked to strategy. It includes both business and technological aspects (Dhar and Sundararajan, 2007), transcends organizational boundaries (Bharadwaj et al., 2013), and is based on data insights (Sia et al., 2016). *Mobilization for and acceleration of digital transformation by TMTs* is another critical activity at the strategic level, and is used, among other things, to attract a new generation of workers (e.g., Matzler et al., 2018) and to establish digital mindsets (e.g., Hansen et al., 2011). With a more operational focus but embedded in the strategic orientation, the *exploitation and leveraging of digital capabilities* is important for organizations, mainly regarding online informational capabilities (Barua et al., 2004), big data analytics capabilities (e.g., Hausladen and Zipf, 2018) and digital platform capabilities (e.g., Karimi and Walter, 2015). Building on such technologies not only internally, but with the goal of creating *digital innovation*, including the development of novel products, processes or business models (e.g., Hinings et al., 2018), is vital. This also includes *merging human-machine interaction* as a core activity to establish value-adding and sustainable synergies between technology and humans (Bajer, 2017).

*Integration mechanisms* are crucial for aligning these new elements with existing ones within an organization. First, *developing a digital transformation strategy* that ‘serves as a central concept to integrate the entire coordination, prioritization, and implementation of digital transformations within a firm’ (Matt et al., 2015, p. 339) is key to marshalling this integration in the course of DT. Executions of such plans involve activities to *unlock organizations*, for example by developing dynamic capabilities (e.g., Karimi and Walter, 2015) and enhanced organizational learning abilities (e.g., Schuchmann and Seufert, 2015). On the more technical side, organizations need an *increasing technological flexibility*. This can, for example, be achieved by a collaborative and agile enterprise architecture (e.g., Zimmermann et al., 2016). Lastly, integration involves *physical-digital harmonizing* by TMT, including, for example, the promotion of cross-functional cooperation (e.g., Larkin, 2017) and the use of coordination mechanisms to assimilate digital technologies within the organization (e.g., Chatterjee et al., 2002).

#### Outcomes
DT is associated with a variety of outcomes (Henfridsson and Yoo, 2013), the final category of our multi-dimensional framework. These outcomes relate to the gestalt of the organization itself, the environmental surroundings in which the organization is embedded, and the resulting economic consequences. Accordingly, we differentiate between *organizational setups*, *economics* and *spill-overs*.

Outcomes relating to *organizational setups* refer to the configuration of the constituents of the firm (Kanungo et al., 2001) and how organizations change in the course of DT. DT has consequences for organizations, from the way they engage with external stakeholders to their internal processes, down to each individual product. To start with, we found that a focus on *open innovation and crowdsourcing* leads to more *ecosystem-oriented and -embedded organizations* (Berman and Marshall, 2014). This shift continues in the intra-organizational structuring: organizations develop *permeable, agile organizational structures*, and in doing so become agile, adaptable and boundaryless, as manifested in organizational forms such as Holacracy (e.g., Schwer and Hitz, 2018). In addition, management styles change towards *technology-focused and -supported management*. This is evidenced by the increased use of artificial intelligence support and decision support systems (e.g., Kolbjørnsrud et al., 2016). In a similar vein, *digital and customer experience-focused business models* gain importance. This involves both the creation of completely new business models (e.g., Dutra et al., 2018) and the modification of existing business models (e.g., Berman, 2012). Finally, DT in organizations culminates in the outcome of *automatized, data-driven and virtual business processes* through an enhanced use of digital technologies and software for performing tasks (e.g., Dery et al., 2017), as well as the development of *smart, connected and customized products* (e.g., Porter and Heppelmann, 2015).

With regard to *economics*, DT may result in *improved firm performance* and *new forms of value*, caused by an improved service quality (e.g., Bouwman et al., 2011) or cost reductions (e.g., Agarwal et al., 2010). Furthermore, DT has been found to lead to *dynamic and constantly changing industry lead performance* due to changing goods prices (e.g., Bockstedt et al., 2006) or market reactions and turbulences (e.g., Daniel and Wilson, 2003).

Finally, DT also has effects that go beyond the direct control of organizations and affect the environments in which organizations are embedded and which they need to adapt to. These *spill-overs* – divided into *paradigms, systems, industry, information security and individual effects* – form the environment with which firms interact to remain legitimate and successful. We found that DT leads to *paradigms of customer-centricity and connected markets*, reflected in shifts towards an end-to-end commerce focus, mass customization (Weichert, 2017) or user centricity (e.g., Altukhova et al., 2018). Similarly, DT drives *digital-permeated markets, economies and societies* as information and communication technologies increasingly mediate interactions among consumers, within firms, and between firms and their customers (e.g., Tilson et al., 2010). DT thereby causes a *blurring of the boundaries between physical and online industry structures*, including the convergence of physical products and digital services, merging the physical world with online content, and creating an omnichannel environment for the customer (e.g., Brynjolfsson et al., 2013). These effects also lead to a *higher exposure to cyber threats*, including both cyber war threats and data security vulnerability (e.g., Dang-Pham et al., 2017), as well as the resulting need to ensure network and data security (Haggerty, 2017). Finally, we found that firms need to account for the *digitalization of the individual*. As a result, individuals such as customers or workers (Gregory et al., 2018) have and expect, among other things, an increased spatial and temporal flexibility (e.g., Schwarzmüller et al., 2018) and enhanced access to choices and information (e.g., Berman, 2012).

### DISCUSSION OF FINDINGS
Although our findings portray DT as complex and diversified, we can abstract directions concerning the content of organizational change (Armenakis and Bedeian, 1999). From the synthesis of what is known about DT we can derive two distinct, yet interrelated, thematic patterns that help us better understand the peculiarities of DT. In particular, we observe the move towards *malleable organizational designs* that are embedded in and driven by *digital business ecosystems*. We elaborate and interpret each of these patterns in the following.

#### Towards Malleable Organizational Designs
From the multiple organizational facets that are subject to change within the course of DT, we can identify a move towards *malleable organizational designs*. Organizational designs manifest key tenets of a firm’s organization activities and can be described as ‘configuration[s] of the formal organizational arrangements, including the formal structures, processes, and systems that make up an organization’ (Nadler and Tushman, 1997, p. 48). A malleable organizational design can be understood as one that is easily influenced and can be easily changed. The malleable organizational designs that are brought about by DT build on digital technologies and agile structures to adapt rapidly to environmental opportunities and threats. Relentlessly changing organizations have been identified in software industries (Brown and Eisenhardt, 1997). In particular, Huang et al. (2017) say, in summary, that digital firms adapt rapidly though the mechanisms of *data-driven operation* (e.g., fine-grained monitoring and user profiling based on digital technologies), *swift transformation* (e.g., fast redefinition of core markets, identities and activities) and *instant release* (e.g., dynamic innovation of digital offerings based on customer feedback). Our findings also suggest that contemporary firms undertake a general move to configure their organizations so as to enable and support such mechanisms. The *organizational setup* category of our findings indicates such a conclusion. For instance, data-driven operations and decision making are underpinned by *automatized, data-driven and virtual business processes*, as well as *technology-focused and -supported management*. Furthermore, *permeable, agile organizational structures* support swift transformation. Finally, the outcomes of *digital and customer experience-focused digital business models* and of *smart connected and customized products* can be related to the mechanism of instant release, as these are dynamically adaptable and scalable market offerings.

Firms support the move towards a malleable organizational design in several ways. First, as is visible from the *innovation mechanisms* in our framework, they gather the necessary new knowledge and capabilities. For instance, by engaging in *digital innovation*, new digital business models are established that allow for instant release. By building on *new digital capabilities* and *human-machine interaction*, data-driven operations can be achieved. *Developing a digital business strategy*, *digital acceleration* and *digital mobilization* help to unfreeze the organization for swift transformation. Second, the *integration mechanisms* of our framework show that firms fuse this new knowledge and capabilities with what already exists in their organization. Here digital firms and non-digital firms diverge, as the latter have to deal with a pre-existing organizational design, requiring a *digital transformation strategy* and *physical-digital harmonizing*, while digital firms are regularly built from scratch (Tumbas et al., 2017). Nevertheless, as the mechanisms of *unlocking organizations* and *increasing technological flexibility* indicate, a general move towards greater adaptability is evident. An important observation here is that the goal of this adaptability is strongly connected to being in tune with the firm’s environment. This can be seen in the outcome of *ecosystem-oriented and -embedded organizations*.

To summarize, we observe a shift towards malleable organizational designs that enable firms to adapt continuously to their environments. The idea of continuously adaptable organizations is not new (e.g., Weick and Quinn, 1999). However, in the context of DT, it seems much easier for firms, across contexts and not just in software industries, to actually realize such a state. For instance, the accessibility of large volumes of data and the technologies to analyse them to detect environmental changes, as well as the ability to adapt activities that are based on flexible digital technologies, possibly automatically, allow ongoing changes on the basis of environmental feedback or emerging opportunities. At the same time, however, it also becomes progressively harder to differentiate where change is coming from and whether it is unfolding within or across firm boundaries. In particular, digital technologies afford instant release. Such technologies, being generative in nature, allow for continuous innovation, which is often brought about by external parties, such as customers or developers (Parker et al., 2017). Furthermore, a large part of the technological set up may lie outside the control of a particular firm and may evolve unpredictably, at the will of external actors, such as tech giants or digital start-ups. Data-driven operations and decisions tune the firm to environmental feedback, for instance from customers, by utilizing the potential of AI and machine learning to automatically detect and react to changes. Swift transformation requires firms to alter their positioning and capabilities according to new, dynamically emerging and dissolving opportunities. Thus, in the course of DT, the continuous adaptation enabled by malleable organizational designs contributes to a holistic confluence of environmental turbulence, IT systems and organizational capabilities. This is termed ‘digital ecodynamics’, a phenomenon that ‘has no separations among its three core elements, but it is the wholeness of the fused interactions among the three elements’ (El Sawy et al., 2010, p. 837). Accordingly, this holistic confluence differs from traditional views that differentiated organizational change as triggered by technology, organizational agency or social interaction (Markus and Robey, 1988). While these aspects continue to be relevant in and of themselves (e.g., Boudreau and Robey, 2005), they also become inseparably interwoven in the context of DT. Furthermore, as key pervasive technologies become increasingly infrastructural and widely accessible for firms (Tilson et al., 2010), and as external actors become more and more central to delivering important capabilities, the interactions of organizations with and their embeddedness in their environments becomes increasingly complex and intense. Thus, a broader view, one that goes beyond organizational design, is required to expand our understanding of DT.

#### Towards Digital Business Ecosystems
Drawing upon the manifold changes that our review has revealed with regards to antecedents and outcomes, in conjunction with the emergence of malleable organizational designs that dynamically tune firms to their environments, we can identify a move towards *digital business ecosystems* as the second thematic pattern of DT. Business ecosystems are often seen as underpinning the value creation and capture of firms, representing ‘the alignment structure of the multilateral set of partners that need to interact in order for a focal value proposition to materialize’ (Adner, 2017, p. 42). As they shape firm decisions about where and how to compete, business ecosystems are an essential topic for strategy (Jacobides et al., 2018). In recent decades, we have seen numerous companies moving away from hierarchical integrated supply chains and towards these more fragmented networks of strategic partnerships with external entities (Bitran et al., 2007). However, in the course of DT, we contend that through the holistic confluence comprising material, organizational and further environmental dimensions (El Sawy et al., 2010), so-called digital business ecosystems, which in the past were only a topic of interest for IT and software industries, are becoming more and more inseparable from regular business ecosystems and increasingly relevant across sectors as digital technologies diffuse through industries and society. Digital business ecosystems define business environments ‘shaped by a network of interdependencies specifically generated through digital technologies’ (Kopalle et al., 2020, pp. 114–15). A key differential factor that sets digital business ecosystems apart is their turbulent nature (El Sawy and Pereira, 2013). Generally, turbulence can be understood as ‘the conditions of unpredictability in the environment because of rapid changes in customer needs, emerging technologies, and competitive actions’ (Pavlou and El Sawy, 2010, p. 444). In the context of business ecosystems, this turbulence becomes visible especially through the vast number and heterogeneity of interdependent partners that shape competition (e.g., Jacobides et al., 2018), the widespread diffusion and adoption of interconnected generative technologies (e.g., Kopalle et al., 2020), and the constantly changing customer preferences (e.g., Downes and Nunes, 2013). Our findings emphasize the relevance of these factors, and thus a general move towards digital business ecosystems. For instance, we identified that DT is triggered and shaped by a plethora of diverse digital technologies and applications, such as blockchain technologies, AI and the Internet of Things. Also, consumers are increasin...
