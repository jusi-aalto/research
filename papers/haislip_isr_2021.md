Data security breaches (DSBs) are increasing investor and regulator pressure on firms to improve their IT governance (ITG) in an effort to mitigate the related risk. Drawing on upper echelon theory, we argue that DSB risk cannot be mitigated by one executive alone, but, rather, is a shared leadership responsibility of the top management team (TMT; i.e., Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Chief Financial Officer (CFO), and Chief Information Officer (CIO)). By examining a sample of DSBs from 2005 to 2017, our study finds that CEOs with IT expertise are associated with fewer DSBs, with some evidence of a focus on DSBs containing consumer information. Our evidence also suggests that CFOs with IT expertise are less likely to report a DSB in general, as well as DSBs involving employee information or instigated by a person outside of the firm and, to a weaker extent, DSBs containing consumer information. Further, the presence of a CIO as part of the TMT is significantly associated with reduced DSBs of all types examined. Our results are robust to endogeneity concerns and an alternative propensity score matched sample. This study contributes a granular investigation of DSB risk involving executives with IT expertise that extends the upper echelon and ITG literatures. History: T. S.

# 1. Introduction

Data security breaches (DSBs) represent "a security violation in which sensitive, protected, or confidential data is copied, transmitted, viewed, stolen, or used by an unauthorized individual" (Privacy Rights Clearinghouse [2018\)](#page-18-0).[1](#page-15-0) According to a recent Ponemon Institute ([2015\)](#page-18-0) study, U.S. firms report higher average DSB costs (\$15 million) than do firms in the rest of the world. Further, U.S. firms take an average of 46 days, at a cost of \$21,155 per day, to resolve a DSB. Even though the recent DSB at Equifax, where approximately 150 million Americans had their credit records stolen, is believed to be the biggest DSB to date (Fung [2018](#page-17-0)), many DSBs, irrespective of size, cause significant operational interruptions and associated costs (Gessin [2017](#page-17-0)). Regulators are starting to recognize the significant DSB-related problems firms face as is evidenced by the newly created cyber-digital task force in the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC [2018\)](#page-18-0) upgrade to its earlier disclosure guidance (SEC [2011\)](#page-18-0). Thus, the immediate financial loss for firms and the decline in shareholder value are capital market perspectives, while the recent regulatory scrutiny should attract executives' attention when addressing DSB risk.

DSB risk represents a major prioritization for effective information technology governance (ITG) as suggested in the following quote: "Senior executives understand that the global economy is still not sufficiently protected against cyberattacks, despite years of effort and annual spending of tens of billions of dollars. They understand that risk alone undermines trust and confidence in the digital economy, reducing its potential value by as much as \$3 trillion (emphasis added) by 2020. . .understanding the issue is quite different from effectively addressing it. . .only sustained support from senior management can ensure progress and ultimately mitigate the risk of cyberattacks" (James Kaplan, McKinsey & Company, Bailey et al. [2014,](#page-16-0) p. 1). The content from this quotation agrees with recent surveys (Dickson [2015,](#page-17-0) PwC [2015](#page-18-0)) identifying a wider range of C-suite executives sharing the responsibility for security, beyond just the Chief Information Officer (CIO). The shared responsibility is necessary, because each senior executive relies on his/her unique expertise and responsibilities when managing DSB risk as part of information technology (IT) risk and overall business risk. The top management team (TMT) literature consistently identifies the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO), respectively, as the other C-suite executives the CIO needs toworkwith tomanage various forms of IT risk (e.g., Banker et al. [2011](#page-16-0), Vincent et al. [2017](#page-18-0)). Shared beliefs and experiences among the executives produce knowledge transfer, with the CIO representing a central ITG figure to mitigate DSB risk (Benaroch and Chernobai [2017](#page-16-0), Kashmiri et al. [2017](#page-17-0), Feng and Wang [2019\)](#page-17-0).

Related DSB research investigates board-of-directorlevel changes (Higgs et al. [2016](#page-17-0), Benaroch and Chernobai [2017\)](#page-16-0) or the CIO as part of the TMT (Kwon et al. [2013](#page-17-0), Kashmiri et al. [2017](#page-17-0)). These studies do not inspect the TMT as individual, C-suite executives or the potential benefits of their IT expertise on breach types (i.e., hacks vs. financial breaches). Identified gaps in the research are important to address, because senior executives, such as CEOs and CFOs, need to participate in utilizing IT resources to ensure good ITG at the firm (Devaraj and Kohli [2003\)](#page-17-0). In addition, best practice guidelines in COBIT 5 (ISACA [2013](#page-17-0)) and COBIT 5 for information security (ISACA [2012](#page-17-0)) complement the related academic literature and suggest particular responsibilities each executive has in a DSB context (e.g., the firm's information risk profile originated by the CIO and shared with the CEO and CFO), while providing clear information to place these executives in the best position to reduce the likelihood of DSBs.

The purpose of our study is to investigate why firm outcomes related to DSB risk cannot be tied to one executive alone, but, rather, is the shared leadership responsibility of the TMT (i.e., CEO, CFO, and CIO). Relying on upper echelon theory (UET; Hambrick and Mason [1984,](#page-17-0) Hambrick [2007](#page-17-0)), we discuss the key ITGrelated responsibilities CEOs, CFOs, and CIOs face in their attempt to mitigate DSB risk. Consistent with the contention of Carpenter et al. ([2004\)](#page-17-0) that executive background is an important consideration in firm governance, our study further argues that ITG is more effective when IT expertise exists in the firm's TMT. Thus, we examine whether knowledge from CEOs with IT expertise, CFOs with IT expertise, and the CIO as part of the TMT matriculate throughout the firm more smoothly and place the firm in a relatively better position to mitigate the number of reported DSBs, including various types.[2](#page-15-0) For example, the CEO's approval of security policies derived by the CIO and communication of those policies throughout the firm consistent with overall business risk strategy adds an extra layer of security that could reduce the likelihood of employee-related DSBs. A CFO's ability to establish access and other operational internal controls could help to minimize employee and other internal breach risks. Finally, CIOs use their expertise to implement the IT risk-related internal controls originated by the CFO that could reduce overall DSB risk (Vincent et al. [2017,](#page-18-0) Banker and Feng [2019\)](#page-16-0).

Using DSB data from 2005 to 2017, we find that having IT expertise in the firm's TMT is important for managing DSB risk. Specifically, we find consistent results suggesting that CEOs with IT expertise, CFOs with IT expertise, and CIOs reduce the likelihood of a reported DSB. Additional testing provides some evidence that CEOs with IT expertise are associated with fewer consumer-data-related DSBs. This finding suggests that CEOs with IT expertise are particularly concerned with sensitive, consumer data as part of their firm-wide IT risk management practices. Results also show that CFOs with IT expertise are associated with fewer employee-related DSBs, outsider-instigated DSBs, and to a weaker extent, consumer-related DSBs. These results suggest that CFOs with IT expertise effectively manage internal controls related to security in a broad array of compliance-related areas. We also find strong evidence that the presence of the CIO in the TMT is associated with all breach types studied (i.e., financial, employee, consumer, and outside), suggesting that CIOs enhance their firm's risk profile and security budgets around these DSB types. Our results are robust to endogeneity concerns by incorporating propensity score matching (PSM), Heckman ([1979](#page-17-0)) two-stage, two-stage residual inclusion (2SRI), and entropy approaches, as well as different measures of alternative sample and variable specifications.

Our study contributes to the ITG literature in three significant ways. First, we extend the UET (Hambrick and Mason [1984,](#page-17-0) Carpenter et al. [2004,](#page-17-0) Hambrick [2007](#page-17-0)) and ITG (Nolan and McFarlan [2005](#page-18-0)) literatures by taking a granular focus on DSB-related responsibilities of CEOs, CFOs, and CIOs. Second, our granular focus on each TMT executive provides valuable information about how ITG and, in particular, individual executives' IT expertise (e.g., CEO, CFO, and CIO) complement each other to mitigate DSB risk. Third, our research fills in the gap of the existing ITG and DSB research (Benaroch and Chernobai [2017](#page-16-0)) by offering evidence tying the potential benefit from each executive's IT expertise to breach type. Our results suggest that IT expert CEOs and CFOs have value to the firm beyond their typical, executive duties. Further, our consistent findings related to CIOs in the TMT suggest that this executive plays a vital role within the top management group and can work with other executives to reduce the likelihood of DSBs.

Our study also has several practical implications. First, our research empirically tests critical aspects of the COBIT 5 for information security framework (ISACA [2012](#page-17-0)). Next, we provide new insights to boards, management, and regulators interested in improving governance of IT risk. Finding and hiring executives with IT expertise is not a costless exercise. Study findings related to these executives, along with the CIO, can help boards and management with their information security planning. That is, when firms are facing increased risk exposure for certain breach types, our results suggest that having a particular executive with IT expertise can be a benefit. When considering regulation, our findings centered on each executive's DSB-related responsibilities could potentially start a governance-lead roadmap to firms who are concerned with satisfying regulatory scrutiny in general or, more specifically, complying with the recent Securities and Exchange Commission's DSB disclosure guidance (SEC [2018\)](#page-18-0) and the new cyber-digital task force in the Justice Department.

# 2. Literature Review and Hypothesis Development

## 2.1. Extant DSB Research

A large number of studies demonstrate the negative effect of DSBs on a firm's share price (Cavusoglu et al. [2004](#page-17-0), Goel and Shawky [2009,](#page-17-0) Higgs et al. [2016](#page-17-0)). Mitra and Ransbotham [\(2015](#page-18-0)) find increased DSB risk disclosure leads to a greater number of future DSBs, which is contrary to the signaling-related benefits to firms of such disclosure or announcements reported in other studies (i.e., Gordon and Loeb [2002](#page-17-0), Gordon et al. [2010,](#page-17-0) Hu et al. [2012](#page-17-0)).[3](#page-15-0) The conflicting results may be due to the market distinguishing responsibility for different DSB types (Campbell et al. [2003,](#page-16-0) Gordon et al. [2010](#page-17-0), Higgs et al. [2016,](#page-17-0) Smith et al. [2019\)](#page-18-0). For example, Tanimura and Wehrly ([2015\)](#page-18-0) find that DSB firms suffer direct costs when customer data are lost, but do not experience reputation costs related to loss of employee data. Further, Benaroch and Chernobai ([2017\)](#page-16-0) and Richardson et al. [\(2019](#page-18-0)) find inconsistent market results related to different DSB types (e.g., internal, external, customer-related).

While the extant literature on breached firms finds negative impacts and is evolving to include breach types, it is incomplete when it comes to individual TMT executives, ITG, and DSB mitigation. Kwon et al. [\(2013](#page-17-0)) and Kashmiri et al. ([2017\)](#page-17-0) examine the role of the CIO in the TMT on DSB management. Relying on agency theory, Kwon et al. ([2013\)](#page-17-0) report a negative association between having IT executives, who are only ranked top-five in compensation in the TMT, and the likelihood of incurring DSBs. Similarly, when looking at potential contagion effects of the Target DSB on other retailers, Kashmiri et al. ([2017](#page-17-0)) find a strong signal to investors and consequent negative association between having the CIO as part of the TMT and the contagion effect with a much weaker effect when having the Chief Marketing Officer (CMO) on the TMT.[4](#page-15-0)

Higgs et al. ([2016\)](#page-17-0) and Benaroch and Chernobai ([2017\)](#page-16-0) study different board-level IT expertise proxies to identify potential DSB risk mitigation associations. For example, Higgs et al. ([2016\)](#page-17-0) find evidence that breach firms possessing a technology committee portray a positive signal to investors. Focusing on the financial services industry, Benaroch and Chernobai ([2017\)](#page-16-0) examine changes in board-level ITG following 110 operational failures from 1992–2009.[5](#page-15-0) The authors find that firms experiencing IT failures make improvements to the IT competency level on the executive sides of the board, such as an increase in the IT experience of internal executive directors and turnover rate of CIOs at the board level. Although their results suggest that DSBs are indicative of inadequacies of the monitoring of IT resources that invoke changes at the board-level ITG, the investigation of each individual executive's IT expertise across all industries is still unanswered.

Individual TMT executives (e.g. CEO, CFO, and CIO) are in the position to make meaningful, ITrelated decisions that can align IT risk and overall business risk. Additionally, Carpenter et al. ([2004](#page-17-0)) suggest that executive demography/background influence firm governance decisions. Thus, we argue that ITG is more effective when individual, TMT executives possess IT expertise. Further, outside of their boardrelated roles, little is known about how these executives' DSB risk responsibilities overlap with different breach types. Table [1](#page-5-0) categorizes the relevant ITG research cited by objective, theories applied, variables chosen, and results, as well as highlighting our research scope and unique contributions.

#### 2.2. UET and DSB Risk

According to UET, strategic choices made by firms are largely determined by the firm's most powerful executives (Hambrick [2007](#page-17-0)) and are not made in isolation (Hambrick and Mason [1984](#page-17-0)). The UET posits that idiosyncratic differences in executives' experiences are associated with differences in important individual beliefs and cognitive styles that lead them to make different choices (Hambrick and Mason [1984](#page-17-0)). Thus, UET suggests that observable characteristics of executives' backgrounds reflect key formative experiences that are associated with their unique cognitive styles and values. The extant research extends the initial UET literature (e.g., Hambrick and Mason [1984](#page-17-0)) that focuses on executives' background and observable characteristics such as age, functional track, career experiences, and education by examining the role of top managers' power in strategic decision making (Finkelstein [1992](#page-17-0), Daily and Johnson [1997](#page-17-0), Jensen and Zajac [2004](#page-17-0)).

Table 1. Literature Review on DSB-Executive and Board-Level Studies

<span id="page-6-0"></span>Vincent et al. ([2017](#page-18-0)) draw upon UET to suggest that shared beliefs and experience among top executives are necessary to achieve key IT-related outcomes. Recent DSB research identifies the CIO as a central ITG figure to mitigate DSB risk (Benaroch and Chernobai [2017](#page-16-0), Kashmiri et al. [2017](#page-17-0), Feng and Wang [2019\)](#page-17-0). Further, frequent interactions between the CEO and senior IT executives, such as the CIO, increase the amount of shared knowledge and the firm's ability to leverage IT (Armstrong and Sambamurthy [1999,](#page-16-0) Johnson and Lederer [2005,](#page-17-0) Wu et al. [2015](#page-18-0)). Having established through UET that executives possess different backgrounds and exhibit significant, idiosyncratic beliefs that affect their judgments (Carpenter et al. [2004](#page-17-0), Jensen and Zajac [2004](#page-17-0)) and that frequent interactions among these executives can improve IT-related processes, we now consider integrating these TMT executives' backgrounds into key ITG roles. Specifically, we consider how IT expertise in the TMT (defined as the CEO, CFO, and CIO) is associated with the probability of firms reporting a DSB.

Table 2 identifies the CEO, CFO, and CIO as key executives that define governance objectives and specifies decision rights, access controls, and accountabilityin the information security context[.6](#page-15-0) For example, CEOs are users (information risk profile) and approvers (security policies) of information originated by the CIO and other information created by lower-level IT managers. It is important to note that CEOs also possess a more active role in DSB governance by having the wherewithal to refine and approve security policies derived by the CIO (and other lower-level IT managers). Then, they communicate those policies throughout the firm in accordance with their business risk strategy.[7](#page-15-0) Next, CFOs are expected to take on a more detailed role than the CEO by approving the information security budget and creating access and other operational-level internal controls. The CFO, like the CEO, is a consumer of the security awareness manual, but also consumes information contained in firm-wide security policies and the information risk profile. Finally, the CIO is a user of information contained in the security policies, information security review reports, and awareness manual and originates the information security budget and firmwide information risk profile. The CIO helps to implement the IT risk-related internal controls originated by the CFO.

The next section integrates our above arguments to explain how each TMT executive's IT expertise (i.e., experience and/or education) can mitigate DSB risk.

## 2.3. CEOs' Responsibilities Related to DSB Risk

A key tenet of UET is that TMT executives act in accordance with their own backgrounds and experiences (Hambrick and Mason [1984](#page-17-0)). We begin our discussion of this topic with the top executive. The CEO has the primary role of establishing and overseeing firm policies (Masli et al. [2016\)](#page-18-0). The CEO's background and experiences help to shape firm-level risk management practices that could enhance ITG (Vincent et al. [2017](#page-18-0)). Jarvenpaa and Ives [\(1991](#page-17-0)) provide evidence that CEOs with an IT background have stronger IT-related policies than their peers. Further, firms that employ a CEO who is comfortable with technology tend to find that the comfort level with IT permeates throughout the firm (Bassellier et al. [2003\)](#page-16-0). For example, firms with CEOs possessing IT expertise improve the information environment for their

<span id="page-7-0"></span>in a timely fashion (Haislip et al. [2020\)](#page-17-0). The extant literature is less clear, however, on the importance of

the CEO's IT expertise and specific IT risks. Vincent et al. [\(2017](#page-18-0)) suggest that CEOs are in the best position within the firm to oversee IT risk management practices and improve ITG. The CEO communicates with the CIO about current and future IT issues (Vincent et al. [2017](#page-18-0)). We extrapolate this point further by contending that CEOs with IT expertise are likely to be more effective than their non-IT expert peers with regard to their firm-wide, IT risk management responsibilities and policies. As presented in Table [2,](#page-6-0) CEOs take the information contained in the information risk profile and review reports, discuss various security issues with the security manager (originator of security policies), and have the expertise to suggest improvements to those policies before approving them. Once approved, it is critical that the CEO with IT expertise help establish a culture of information security awareness through the communication of policies, goals, and objectives to all employees. Consequently, we propose that CEOs with IT expertise benefit firms in the following manner.

Hypothesis 1. Firms possessing a CEO with IT expertise are less likely to incur a reportable DSB than are firms without a CEO with IT expertise.

## 2.4. CFOs' Responsibilities Related to DSB Risk

As the head financial executive, the CFO is responsible for assessing financial planning and control risks as part of an integrative evaluation of internal controls that result in efficient and effective business processes (Li et al. [2010](#page-17-0)). Thus, CFOs are responsible for prioritizing unit-specific IT needs where operational issues are addressed and solutions match-up with proper internal control structures (Sambamurthy and Zmud [2012](#page-18-0)). Vincent et al. [\(2017](#page-18-0)) rely on UET and emphasize that increased interactions between the CFO and CIO help to build a synergistic relationship, which then facilitates an IT-business knowledge exchange. This shared knowledge and experience can then help CFOs improve a firm's IT controls over compliance and information security. Improved IT controls should be important to CFOs given that they are ultimately held accountable for internal control weaknesses (Haislip et al. [2016](#page-17-0)) and operational failures (Banker and Feng [2019](#page-16-0)).

A CFO's specific background and experience are important factors in a firm's policy setting process (Bertrand and Schoar [2003](#page-16-0), Carpenter et al. [2004\)](#page-17-0). Tech-savvy CFOs (i.e., CFOs with IT expertise in our context) understand the significant role of IT within the firm's business model in order to increase the efficiency of finance operations, meet return on investment, and properly secure the firm's intellectual property. In conjunction with the CFO's responsibility to set access and other operational controls as outlined in Table [2](#page-6-0), we argue that a CFO with IT expertise is in the best position to manage employeerelated data, such as demographics, payroll, and benefits, by devoting sufficient resources to secure that part of the information system. CFOs with IT expertise would be able to align DSB risk with business risks in order to create effective security-related internal controls. Thus, we propose that CFOs with IT expertise benefit firms in the following manner.

Hypothesis 2. Firms possessing a CFO with IT expertise are less likely to incur a reportable DSB than are firms not possessing CFOs with IT expertise.

### 2.5. CIOs' Responsibilities Related to DSB Risk

A considerable body of research emphasizes the importance of the CIO as a representative of the inner circle of a firm's leadership that can influence the firms' ITG processes and have a direct effect on the IT budget allocation. As CIOs have made their way into the boardroom, they have become key figures in terms of pushing IT-related decisions (Applegate and Elam [1992](#page-16-0)) and identifying IT risks (Stephens et al. [1992](#page-18-0), Nolan and McFarlan [2005](#page-18-0)). The CIO also nurtures appropriate capabilities, structures, and processes to help firms develop their digital business strategies (Bharadwaj et al. [2013\)](#page-16-0) and to sustain a competitive advantage (Lim et al. [2012](#page-18-0)). Thus, the CIO's technical and business knowledge are essential to successful innovation (Earl and Feeny [1994\)](#page-17-0), and the market often reacts positively to high-quality CIO appointments (Chatterjee et al. [2001](#page-17-0)). In particular, Lim et al. ([2013a\)](#page-18-0) show that firms having senior IT executives, such as CIOs with greater structural power or IT-related expertise, are more likely to attract public recognition for their firm's IT capability. Further, Banker et al. ([2011\)](#page-16-0) find that the CIO reporting structure (i.e., whether CIO reports to CFO or CEO) must be aligned with the firm's strategic positioning to improve overall firm performance.

We argue that firms who possess a CIO as a part of their TMT have the highest required level of IT expertise to effectively carry out the responsibilities related to managing various DSB types. CIOs can accurately assess the level of the firm's IT investments (Lim et al. [2013b](#page-17-0)) and ensure the protection of customer data (Johnson and Goetz [2007\)](#page-17-0). As part of the TMT, CIOs would have a superior range of IT risk management responsibilities, including originating the security budget as part of the larger IT investment <span id="page-8-0"></span>and creating a firm-wide information risk profile. That is, they work closely with their subordinate in charge of information security (e.g., the information security manager or CISO) when crafting their IT budget and would have more authority to align all security issues with firm policies as presented in Table [2](#page-6-0). Therefore, consistent with the earlier UET discussion and cited literature above, the CIO on the TMT should be able to advocate for data security effectively to the CEO and CFO. We predict that the aggregate skill sets of the CIO as a key ITG executive on the TMT should reduce the possibility of reportable DSB occurrences in the following manner.

Hypothesis 3. Firms possessing CIOs as part of TMT are less likely to incur a reportable DSB than are firms that do not possess a CIO.

# 3. Method

# 3.1. Sample and Data Sources

We identify 8,061 reported DSBs from 2005 through 2017 using the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse.[8](#page-15-0) The Privacy Rights Clearinghouse is a not-for-profit organization that collects DSB data from state government reporting agencies and various media outlets (e.g., news feeds, blogs, websites, and notification documents from state governments). Consistent with the requirements stated in the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, this data set represents mandatory disclosure of DSBs if customer records are lost. DSBs from the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse have been used in several, related studies (e.g., Sen and Borle [2015](#page-18-0), Higgs et al. [2016](#page-17-0), Schatz and Bashroush [2016,](#page-18-0) Martin et al. [2017](#page-18-0), Pang and Tanriverdi [2017,](#page-18-0) Gwebu et al. [2018](#page-17-0), Yen et al. [2018\)](#page-18-0).

Of the 8,061 reported DSBs identified, we eliminate 7,484 private firms or government entities due to publicly unavailable financial data, leaving us with 577 DSB observations. A subsequent cross-match with Compustat, Center for Research in Security Pricing (CRSP), and Audit Analytics[9](#page-15-0) results in a final sample of 502 DSBs. We use a full population-based control sample from Compustat, rather than a matched-pair design in our main analyses.[10](#page-15-0) For our control group, we include all available firm-year observations with necessary data available in Compustat, Audit Analytics, and BoardEx. Our total sample has 51,473 firm-year observations, including the 502 DSBs. Panel A of Table [3](#page-9-0) summarizes our sample selection process. Panel B of Table [3](#page-9-0) provides a yearly distribution of our sample, as DSBs do not necessarily occur uniformly over time. Appendix A lists variable definitions.

Consistentwith prior research (i.e., Campbell et al. [2003](#page-16-0), Martin et al. [2017](#page-18-0), Gwebu et al. [2018](#page-17-0), Yen et al. [2018\)](#page-18-0), we conduct a subsequent manual search on LexisNexis for key words such as (1) breach, (2) hack, (3) data loss, (4) theft, (5) stole, (6) compromised, and (7) misplaced in the Wall Street Journal, USA Today, the Washington Post, and the New York Times to enhance the completeness and accuracy of our data. Similar to the DSB-type measures examined in Richardson et al. [\(2019](#page-18-0)), we examine DSBs related to monetary or employee confidential information as follows: (a) Financial indicates that the breach included financial information such as social security numbers or bank information; (b) Employee indicates that the data loss involves employees of the breached firm; (c) Consumer indicates that the data loss involves consumer data from the breached firm; (d) Outside indicates that the DSB was initiated by someone from outside of the firm. Appendix B lists the coding rules for breach types and abbreviated DSB examples.

# 3.2. Independent Variables

We isolate our three variables of interest, CEOEXIT, CFOEXIT, and CIOTMT to examine our hypotheses (Hypotheses [1](#page-7-0)–3).[11](#page-16-0) To measure IT expertise (EXIT), we first identify the CEOs and CFOs in our sample firms using BoardEx. We then read the biographies provided by BoardEx for the executives. If the biography lacks any necessary information, we review the biographies of the CEOs and CFOs using several online sources, such as Corporate Library, Bloomberg, BusinessWeek, or Forbes to determine if the CEOs and CFOs have IT expertise. IT expertise (EXIT) is comprised of a synergistic relation between knowledge and experience (Bassellier et al. [2001](#page-16-0), Lim et al. [2013a](#page-18-0), Boritz et al. [2018](#page-16-0), Haislip and Richardson [2018\)](#page-17-0). Thus, we measure CEOs' and CFOs' IT expertise if they meet the criteria for either ITDEG or ITEXP, where ITDEG represents an academic degree in computer science, electrical engineering, or information systems, and ITEXP present any previous IT-related position of employment (e.g., CIO or equivalent IT executives, such as Chief Technology Officer (CTO), vice president of information technology, or IT consultant).[12](#page-16-0) One author and two research assistants were independently involved in the coding process. The percentage of agreement (the interrater reliability) among these three independent coders was 96.12% and 95.46% for the CEOEXIT and CFOEXIT variables, respectively. These agreement scores are well above the recommended threshold of 70% (Cohen [1960\)](#page-17-0).

Similarly, we identify the third executive, CIO, from BoardEx, official SEC documents (e.g., Form 10- K and DEF 14A) as well as other biographical websites.

First, we manually check whether firms have a CIO position serving on the top management team (CIOTMT) by specifically examining if they employ a person with the title CIO (or other "Chief" level IT position such as CTO). Second, for testing CIO's structural power (Lim et al. [2013a\)](#page-18-0), we further consider whether firms have a CIO with multiple additional titles (CIOTITLES), such as vice president of information technology, IT consultant, or other official titles for IT executives. Third, we further document whether the firm reports any person responsible for IT at the firm that is not necessarily at the "Chief" level (ITEXEC). These data are independently collected by two authors and the percentage of agreement was 100% for both CIOTITLES and ITEXEC. Appendix C lists examples of IT expertise for our three TMT executives.

# 3.3. Empirical Model Specification

To test our hypotheses (Hypotheses [1](#page-7-0)–[3](#page-8-0)) about the association between our three executives and the occurrence of a reportable DSB, we specify the following logistic regression[13](#page-16-0) model in Equation (1):

Breach [ Financial, Employee,Consumer, Outside]<sup>i</sup>,<sup>t</sup>

α<sup>0</sup> + α1CEOEXITi,<sup>t</sup> + α2CFOEXITi,<sup>t</sup>

+ α3CIOTMTi,<sup>t</sup> + Teah Comm α4LnATi,<sup>t</sup>

- + α18CostLeaderi,<sup>t</sup> + α19ProductDiffi,<sup>t</sup>

+ α20EarnVoli,<sup>t</sup> + з<sup>i</sup>,<sup>t</sup>,

(1)

where Breach equals one if the firm reports a DSB in the current year t and zero otherwise.

To further examine the level of DSB risks, Breach is re-examined by the different DSB types: (a) Financial; (b) Employee; (c) Consumer, (d) Outside. In Equation (1), the variables of interest, the three executives (CEOEXIT, CFOEXIT, and CIOTMT) in year t, are examined between Breach and Non-Breach firms. We predict that the coefficients on CEOEXIT, CFOEXIT, and CIOTMT (α1, α2, and α3) will be negative, indicating a negative relationship between the reported DSBs and these executives.[14](#page-16-0)

For control variables, we include measures of size (LnAT) and performance (ROA, Loss, Leverage, and Zscore), because larger and more successful firms are more attractive targets for potential DSBs (Wang et al. [2014](#page-18-0), Higgs et al. [2016,](#page-17-0) Benaroch and Chernobai [2017](#page-16-0)). We also include Weak, Foreign, Merger, Restructure, EarnVol, and Extra, because firms with weak internal control environments or more complicated operational structures (Higgs et al. [2016](#page-17-0)) may be more susceptible to DSBs. We include Big4 as these highquality auditors tend to serve as external monitors for their client firms. Consistent with Banker et al. ([2011\)](#page-16-0), we control for Porter's [\(1980](#page-18-0)) two archetypical business strategies (i.e., product differentiation, ProductDiff, and cost leadership, CostLeader). We control for HighTech, Automate, and Transform, which identify industries that are potentially more likely to use technology (Chatterjee et al. [2001,](#page-17-0) Dehning et al. [2003\)](#page-17-0). These variables identify the firm's likelihood of utilizing IT within their operations, which might make them more susceptible to a DSB. Appendix A provides a detailed description of our variables.[15](#page-16-0)

# 4. Results

#### 4.1. Descriptive Statistics

Table [4](#page-11-0) presents a univariate analysis of our variables, comparing the split between Breach and Non-Breach (control) groups. Breach firms are less likely to have CIOs on the TMT (CIOTMT) than Non-Breach firms. Insight from Deloitte ([2020\)](#page-17-0) suggests that firms in IT-intensive industries are more prone to cyberattacks and have a higher risk appetite than other industries, but they tend to have significant technical capability and IT resources. For this reason, we further examine individual executives' IT expertise only at firms that are not in IT-intensive industries.[16](#page-16-0) Within the non-IT intensive industries we find that the Breach firms are less likely to have CEOs with IT expertise (CEOEXIT), CFOs with IT expertise (CFOEXIT), and CIOs on the TMT (CIOTMT). Overall, initial univariate results support our hypotheses, but appear stronger for the non-IT industry firms. At the firm level, the Breach group appears to be larger, less likely to report a loss, less likely to report a material weakness, more likely to employ a Big 4 auditor, more likely to have foreign operations or take part in merger activities, more likely to take an automation approach, and more likely to report an extraordinary item, report a higher Zscore, and report more negative restructuring activities. Results pertaining to the control variables suggest that breach firms use a product differentiation approach more often than a cost leader approach and have more volatile earnings than control firms.

## 4.2. Results from Testing Hypotheses [1](#page-7-0)–[3](#page-8-0)

Table [5](#page-12-0) reports the results of Hypotheses [1](#page-7-0)–[3](#page-8-0). To facilitate comparative analyses, we report results of the following four models in columns (henceforth, Col.): base model with IT-intensive firms excluded in Col. (1); base model with full samples (including ITintensive firms) in Col. (2); base model with firm-fixed effects and IT-intensive firms excluded in Col. (3); and (4) base model with firm-fixed effects in Col. (4). As previously discussed, firms in IT-intensive industries may have greater technical capability to quickly discover and remedy attacks. Therefore, we perform the analysis excluding firms in these industries in Cols. (1) and (3) as executives with IT expertise would be of most benefit to these firms due to a lack of other IT advantages. However, as shown in Cols. (1) and (3) of Table [5,](#page-12-0) we still find supporting evidence of Hypotheses [1](#page-7-0)–[3,](#page-8-0) suggesting that CEOs with IT expertise and CFOs with IT expertise, as well as CIOs as part of TMT, are less likely to be associated with a DSB, even outside of IT industries.

To check whether the observed relation between ITG key responsibilities and DSBs is driven by timeinvariant firm-specific effects that are not explicitly controlled for, we also find results supporting Hypotheses [1](#page-7-0)–[3](#page-8-0) after adding firm-fixed effects in Cols. (3) and (4). Regarding Hypothesis [1,](#page-7-0) we find that CEOs with IT expertise are less likely to be associated with a DSB (CEOEXIT negative coefficients; p < 0.10, p < 0.01, p < 0.05, respectively) in Cols. (1), (3), and (4). This result provides some evidence suggesting that CEOs with IT expertise are effective at mitigating DSB risk. Consistent with Hypothesis [2,](#page-7-0) we find the CFOs with IT expertise are less likely to have a reported DSB in all four models (CFOEXIT negative coefficients; p < 0.05, p < 0.10, p < 0.01, p < 0.01, respectively), suggesting that CFOs with IT expertise are effective at reducing the likelihood of a DSB regardless of industry. Finally, we find that the CIO as a part of the TMT is significantly associated with a lower probability of a DSB in all four models (CIOTMT negative coefficients; all at p < 0.001). Specifically, having a CIO on the TMT can be beneficial for firms looking to mitigate DSB risk across all industries. Our evidence supports Hypotheses [1](#page-7-0)–[3](#page-8-0).

Next, we check whether our results are influenced by the presence of a board-level technology committee (TechComm) as an influencer of ITG (Higgs et al. [2016](#page-17-0), Benaroch and Chernobai [2017](#page-16-0)), and we interpret our control variables. Our IT expertise variables of interest remain qualitatively unaltered, regardless of whether a technology committee is significant or not in the models. With regard to control variables, as expected, the results suggest that larger firms are more likely to report a DSB, as LnAT is consistently positive and significant. Further, Leverageis

also positive and significant, indicating firms with more debt may be more susceptible to a DSB. Also, firms in high-tech industries, firms with a Big 4 auditor, and firms with a higher Zscore are more likely to report a DSB, while firms with foreign operations or an automate approach are less likely to report a DSB. Finally, firms that take a cost leader approach are more likely to report a DSB.

In Table [6](#page-13-0), we use logistic regressions to further explore the impacts of CEOEXIT, CFOEXIT, and CIOTMT on different DSB types using the base model with a full sample in Cols. (1), (3), (5), and (7) and controlling firm-fixed effects in Cols. (2), (4), (6), and (8).We find some evidence that firms employing a CEO with IT expertise are less likely to experience DSBs that involve consumer data (CEOEXIT coefficient = −0.007, p < 0.05) in Col. (6). This finding suggests that CEOs with IT expertise are particularly concerned with sensitive, consumer data as part of their firm-wide IT risk management practices. Similarly, after controlling for firm-fixed effect in Cols. (4), (6), and (8), the results suggest that firms employing a CFO with IT expertise are less likely to report DSBs involving employee information (CFOEXIT coefficient = −0.010, p < 0.05),[17](#page-16-0) DSBs instigated by outsiders (CFOEXIT coefficient = −0.006, p < 0.05), and to a weaker extent, DSBs of consumer information (CFOEXIT coefficient = −0.008, p < 0.10). These results suggest that CFOs with IT expertise effectively manage internal controls related to security in a broad array of compliance-related areas. Interestingly, we find statistically strong and consistent evidence that firms with a CIO as part of their TMT are less likely to have DSBs from any of the DSB types tested (CIOTMT negative coefficients; all at least p < 0.05 across all models). We infer that CIOs, as the key executive for securing IT systems, are accountable for mitigating all DSB risks.[18](#page-16-0)

#### 4.3. Additional Analyses

To mitigate endogeneity or reverse causality issues, we conduct additional analyses by incorporating PSM, Heckman ([1979\)](#page-17-0) two-stage, 2SRI, and entropy approaches. Our results may be subject to selection bias, because the decision to initiate one of our executives is not random. The results of these additional analyses can be found in Table [7.](#page-13-0) [19](#page-16-0)

<span id="page-13-0"></span>Table 6. Executives' IT Expertise and DSB Types

Notes. All variables are as defined in Appendix A and presented in the separate document. The p-values reported in all analyses are one-sided where a prediction is made and two-sided otherwise. The p-values are calculated based on standard errors adjusted for heteroscedasticity (White [1980](#page-18-0)).

\*Significance level of 0.10; \*\*0.05; \*\*\*0.01.

First, we use the model in Appendix D to create a PSM sample (Rosenbaum and Rubin [1983,](#page-18-0) Shipman et al. [2017\)](#page-18-0), where we match on the likelihood of the firm having a specific ITG executive in Col. (1). We alternatively use this model to create a PSM sample where we match on the likelihood of the firm reporting a DSB in Col. (2).[20](#page-16-0) In Col. (1), both CFOEXIT and CIOTMT are negative and significant (p < 0.05), supporting Hypotheses [2](#page-7-0) and [3](#page-8-0). Further, in Col. (2), where we match on the likelihood of a Breach, CFOEXIT is negative and significant (coefficient = −1.053, p = 0.045).

Second, we use a Heckman ([1979\)](#page-17-0) two-stage approach to calculate the inverse Mills ratio (IMR) separately for each executive and rerun Equation [\(1\)](#page-9-0). As shown in Col. (3) of Table 7, we find qualitatively similar results for Hypothesis [2](#page-7-0) (albeit weaker with p < 0.10) and Hypothesis [3.](#page-8-0) Although the IMR result is significant, which suggests an endogeneity issue does exist, our variables remain significant.

Fourth, we use an entropy balancing approach which calibrates the weights of each observation, ensuring the balance of covariates in both the treatment and control groups (Hainmueller [2012,](#page-17-0) Shroff et al. [2017](#page-18-0)). As presented in both Cols. (4) and (5) of Table [7,](#page-13-0) we find consistent results related to Hypothesis [3](#page-8-0) (p < 0.01). Overall, our main results are unaffected by the additional tests that specifically control for self-selection bias.[21](#page-16-0)

#### 4.4. Robustness Checks

We use different methods for measuring our variables in order to assess the robustness of the results. First, in addition to the criteria previously used, we consider an executive's previous experience working in any position at an IT firm. We create a new measure combining all three detailed levels of each executives' IT-related expertise: (i) an IT-related academic degree (ITDEG); (ii) prior IT-related employment (ITEXP); or (iii) prior work at an IT firm (ITFIRMEXP). We rerun all our analyses including these measures for the CEO and CFO (CEOEXITEXPANDED and CFOEXITEXPANDED). As shown in Col. (1) of Table 8, neither of the alternative measures (CEOEXITEXPANDED and CFOEXITEXPANDED) is significant.[22](#page-16-0) In an untabulated analysis, we look at each of the IT

Notes. All variables are as defined in Appendix A and presented in the separate document. The p-values reported in all analyses are onesided where a prediction is made and two-sided otherwise.

expertise criteria individually and note that ITEXP for both the CEO (relatively weaker result) and CFO is negative and significant (CEOEXIT coefficient = −1.15; p < 0.10, CFOEXIT coefficient = −1.11; p < 0.01), suggesting that this measure may most directly capture each executive's cumulative ITrelated experience.

Next, we use two alternative specifications of CIO variables with different titles (Grover et al. [1993\)](#page-17-0) and structural power (Armstrong and Sambamurthy [1999](#page-16-0), Lim et al. [2013a](#page-18-0)). First, ITEXEC is an indicator variable coded one if any employee's job title indicates that (s)he is in charge of IT, but is not necessarily part of the TMT. In Col. (2) of Table 8, we find this variable to be negative and significant (ITEXEC coefficient = −1.152; p < 0.01). Second, CIOTITLES, is a count of the number of titles representative of the structural power granted to the CIO. In Col. (3) of Table 8, we find this variable to be negative and significant (CIOTITLES coefficient = −0.621; p < 0.01). Our overall findings suggest that either having a CIO as a key IT executive or granting the CIO greater structural power can be beneficial for firms looking to mitigate DSB risk.

# 5. Conclusions

DSBs are costly problems for TMTs to address. Our study investigates the TMT as individual, C-suite executives and the potential benefits of their IT expertise in a DSB context. Specifically, we postulate that having a CEO/CFO with IT expertise or a CIO on that TMT could help to set and enforce strong IT policies and controls to mitigate DSB risk. We also investigate various breach types in order to address prior mixed findings in the extant literature.

To summarize our key findings, IT expertise at the TMT level plays a significant role in reducing reportable DSB occurrences. We find some evidence suggesting CEOs with IT expertise are associated with fewer DSBs overall as well as fewer consumer-informationrelated DSBs. CFOs with IT expertise are associated with fewer DSBs overall, employee-related DSBs, DSBs initiated by someone outside the firm, and to a weaker extent, consumer-related DSBs. CIOs on the TMT provide the most comprehensive benefit in this context. Specifically, they are associated with fewer DSBs overall and fewer DSBs from all types investigated. Thus, we find evidence suggesting that the differing effectiveness across these executives is due to the different data-level focal areas each executive has when it comes to internal controls over access and security processes.

Our study is subject to some caveats. Consistent with prior research (Sen and Borle [2015,](#page-18-0) Higgs et al. [2016](#page-17-0), Schatz and Bashroush [2016,](#page-18-0) Martin et al. [2017](#page-18-0), Pang and Tanriverdi [2017](#page-18-0), Gwebu et al. [2018](#page-17-0), Yen et al. [2018\)](#page-18-0), our analyses rely on reportable DSBs from <span id="page-15-0"></span>the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse [\(privacyrights.org\)](http://privacyrights.org). As more data becomes available, future research should investigate interactions among the executives and other potential key managers. Additionally, factors such as IT intensity and the current state of DSBs could play a critical role in determining the costs or

benefits of remediating DSBs and, therefore, might be a fruitful, future research endeavor. Further, a survival analysis should be considered when the necessary data are publicly available and consistently reported by breach firms.

In conclusion, our study pertaining to individual, C-suite executives helps to advance the ITG and upper echelon literatures in a DSB context. Our testing of various breach types also contributes to the extant DSB literature. Our executive IT expertise findings, more specifically, could represent an ITG strategy to directly address Sen and Borle's [\(2015](#page-18-0)) security spending issue (i.e., that increased security spending does not necessarily equal DSB risk mitigation). Future research should more closely match security spending with ITG-related, DSB risk-mitigation strategies.

Our study also contains some practical TMT executive-level and firm-level implications. In general, our results are consistent with Weill and Ross's ([2004](#page-18-0)) arguments involving effective ITG at the TMT level. More specifically directed at DSB risk, our results related to CEOs with IT expertise are consistent with PwC's Global CEO Survey (PwC [2015](#page-18-0)), suggesting that IT-savvy CEOs see technologies related to mitigating DSBs as a top-three most important type of digital methodology for their firm. Similarly, the results related to CFOs with IT expertise agree with a recent Gartner ([2015](#page-17-0)) survey singling out the critical investment in controls designed to prevent DSBs. Our strong findings for CIOs on the TMT add to the related guidance from COBIT 5 for information security (ISACA [2012\)](#page-17-0) and consistently suggest that they are the key executive for securing IT systems. Finally, our granular explanation of each executive's DSBrelated responsibility could potentially provide firms the start of a governance-led roadmap for compliance with the SEC's and Justice Department's cyber regulations.

The data used are publicly available from the sources cited in the text.

# Endnotes

<sup>1</sup> The Privacy Rights Clearinghouse data set represents mandatory disclosure of DSBs as required by state law.

<sup>2</sup> Similar to Sen and Borle ([2015](#page-18-0)), we identify the DSBs as "reportable data security breaches" to be consistent with the guidance offered by our Privacy Rights Clearinghouse data set.

3 We also acknowledge different streams of the DSB literature that do not focus on capital market impacts. The criminal justice literature focuses on alert data and monitoring (Ransbotham and Mitra [2009,](#page-18-0) Mitra and Ransbotham [2015,](#page-18-0) Lee et al. [2016](#page-17-0)). A separate line of DSB research utilizes information foraging theory (how individuals conduct information searches analogous to animals hunting for food [Pirolli [2007](#page-18-0), Wang et al. [2015\]](#page-18-0)), and deterrence theory (a strategy intended to dissuade an individual from taking an action not yet started [Jervis [1982](#page-17-0)]), to better understand how employees search for and interact with firm-contained, security information. Generalizations from the above-cited literature are limited due to the usage of student samples for actual employees, different search tools across studies, identifying perceptions instead of actual behavior, and relatively small data sets.

4 Additionally, Kashmiri et al. ([2017\)](#page-17-0) do not find a significant interaction of CMO presence on the TMT and the IT capability of the retailer on the contagion effect. Combined with the findings of Martin et al. ([2017\)](#page-18-0) that the CMO works with customers post-breach to help ensure they do not leave for a competitor, we argue that the CMO serves a DSB remediation role rather than potentially a DSB mitigation role, and therefore, we do not include this executive in our upcoming analyses.

<sup>5</sup> The financial industry has a unique IT risk infrastructure that is not generalizable to other industries. According to a recent report of ITG (Westby [2015](#page-18-0)), financial sector boards have more technology committees (86%) and risk committees (98%) than any other industry. Also, it has the highest percentage (88%) of Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs) and is the only sector to have 100% Chief Risk Officers (CROs; the next highest industry is IT/telecom at 57%). Our results are unchanged if we limit the sample to financial firms. Analogously, we reach the same conclusions when eliminating financial firms.

6 COBIT 5 for information security (ISACA [2012\)](#page-17-0) complements our UET-based arguments for each TMT executive's association with DSB risk outlined in Table [2](#page-6-0).

7 Kwon and Johnson ([2014](#page-17-0)) emphasize the importance of both lowerlevel and upper-level managers paying close attention to securityrelated policies for strategic best practices.

8 The sample begins in 2005 and ends in 2017, because the former is the year [privacyrights.org](http://privacyrights.org) started their data collection and the latter is for the availability of our data analysis. It can often take a significant amount of time for DSBs to be discovered and reported to the [privacyrights.org](http://privacyrights.org) database.

9 We confirm that, at the time of data collection, the Audit Analytics data included all hacks (319 observations) in our sample, further validating our data collection.

<sup>10</sup>We thank the review team for suggesting a full population-based control sample to avoid choice-based sample bias. Additionally, we also re-estimate our models using a matched pair design (PSM) and <span id="page-16-0"></span>find that our inferences remain the same (further discussed in Section [4.3](#page-11-0)).

<sup>11</sup> Amato (2017) finds that firms employing a Chief Operating Officer (COO) have drastically been reduced from 48 percent in 2000 to only approximately 29 percent in 2016, with the CFO taking over operational duties. In addition, we do not come across any academic research identifying the COO as an important executive in a DSB context. Consequently, we do not include the COO as part of our executive sample.

<sup>12</sup>We also considered a person to have IT expertise if they previously worked in any position at an IT firm (ITFIRMEXP), with IT industries defined as having a three-digit Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) code of 737, 367, or 357. See the CEOEXITEXPANDED and CFOEXITEXPANDED variables in Section [4.4](#page-14-0) for further details.

<sup>13</sup>We thank the anonymous reviewer for the suggestion to include firm-fixed effects. In an effort to control for firm-level unobserved heterogeneity, we estimate a linear probability model (LPM) including firm-fixed effects instead of a logistic model, because the latter would drop observations for all firms where the firm does not experience a DSB in any of the years of our sample. LPM is effective in estimating average partial effects for dichotomous outcome variables (Woolridge [2010\)](#page-18-0).

<sup>14</sup> Some firms experience turnover in their executive positions during the year of the DSB. It is possible that the CEO/CFO with IT expertise was not present when the DSB occurred. Therefore, in untabulated analysis, we include control variables for firms that experienced turnover in the breach year, t, and arrive at the same conclusions. For this model, the coefficient on CEOEXIT (CFOEXIT) is −1.403 (−1.029) with a p-value of 0.098 (0.045).

<sup>15</sup>We estimate Equation ([1](#page-9-0)) by winsorizing all continuous variables at the 1st and 99th percentiles. In an untabulated analysis, we include the raw variables and arrive at the same conclusions presented.

<sup>16</sup>We consider firms to be in an IT-intensive industry if the industry has a three-digit SIC code of 737, 367, or 357. In an untabulated analysis, we include an indicator variable for IT-intensive industries and arrive at similar results to those presented (CFOEXIT and CIOTMT both have negative coefficients; p < 0.05; when including firm-fixed effects CEOEXIT, CFOEXIT, and CIOTMT all have negative coefficients; p < 0.05). Further, when limiting the sample to only IT-intensive industries, we find similar results for CIOTMT, suggesting that, regardless of industry, including the CIO as a part of the TMT is beneficial to mitigate DSB risk.

<sup>17</sup> Table [6](#page-13-0) also presents weak results in Col. (3) for CFOITEX (coefficient = −0.612, p < 0.10), suggesting that firms employing a CFO with IT expertise are less likely to report a breach of employee data.

<sup>18</sup>We consider two measures to further examine whether C-suite executives' IT expertise affects DSB types at various severity levels: (a) Severe is an indicator variable coded one if the firm reports a data breach that contained financial data, the breach was instigated by an outsider who used the data, and at least 5,000 records were breached in the current year, and zero otherwise and (b) SevereCont as a measure of severity scaled from 0 (low severity) to 7 (high severity) based on Amir et al. (2018). In untabulated analyses, we find statistically significantly negative associations between severity measures (Severe and SevereCont) and the presence of a CIO on the TMT (CIOTMT; negative coefficients; all at p < 0.01 across all models in Table [6](#page-13-0)).

<sup>19</sup> For brevity, we report the results of the first stage using a probit model to predict the likelihood to employ our executives as shown in Appendix D. Throughout this subsection, results presented for analyses are based on using CIOTMT as the dependent variable in stage 1. We arrive at similar conclusions when using CFOEXIT or CEOEXIT.

<sup>20</sup> For the PSM model in which we match on Breach, we start with the 502 treatment (Breach) firms, plus 50,971 control (Non-Breach) firms in two ways. As shown in Col. (1) of Table [7](#page-13-0), when we match on CIOTMT we identify 10,478 firms with a CIO serving on the top management team, and 40,995 that do not. Alternatively, as shown in Col. (2) of Table [7,](#page-13-0) the PSM based on Breach yields 265 treatment (Breach) firms and 265 control (Non-Breach) firms in the same year and industry based on two-digit SIC codes with available financial data. Both PSM results show a reasonable explanatory power (Woolridge [2002](#page-18-0)), with a pseudo-R<sup>2</sup> of > 0.200, a significant chi-square, and an area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve > 0.85, suggesting a good model fit. We require the difference in the propensity score to be less than 0.03. We drop any observation where no match is found within this difference. The mean difference in propensity scores for our selected samples is 0.01.

<sup>21</sup> In an untabulated analysis, when excluding IT industries similar to Col. (2) of Table [5,](#page-12-0) we find similar results for the CEO as those presented in Cols. (3), (4), and (5) of Table [5](#page-12-0) (CEOEXIT negative coefficients; p < 0.10).

<sup>22</sup> In an untabulated analysis, when using the PSM sample based on the likelihood of a breach discussed in Section [4.3](#page-11-0), we find significant results for CFOITEXPANDED (coefficient = −0.992; p < 0.00).
