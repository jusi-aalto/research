## Abstract

This editorial reflects on the evolution of digital innovation research over the past 15 years and examines the tension between the massive value created through distributed, generative digital innovation and the disproportionately uneven distribution of that value among stakeholders. We identify three key dimensions that represent the next frontiers: (1) decentering architectural control in modularity and recombinant innovation, (2) understanding externalities and their regulatory implications, and (3) exploring data as drivers of value and organizational change. We call for more balanced and responsible digital innovation research that addresses both positive and negative consequences.

## 1. Introduction

At the dawn of the millennium, digital innovation emerged as a transformative promise. The unforeseen power and ubiquitous presence of digital technology engendered a compelling vision of individuals across society as potential creators who would not only enjoy their own digital experiences in everyday life (Yoo 2010), but also generate novel products. Yoo et al. (2010) associated this promise with the emergence of a new technical architecture, the Layered Modular Architecture (LMA), that established the conditions whereby the focus of value creation shifted from the control of corporates behind opaque walls into the hands of ordinary, yet savvy, individuals and entrepreneurs.

Furthermore, they envisioned that this new technical architecture would bring a new organizing logic that was bound to challenge the traditional one that governed the industrial economy. Digital technology was no longer hidden in beige boxes in the back offices of large corporations. Rather, it was in the hands of people in their everyday contexts (Weiser 1991, Yoo 2010). The ubiquity of digital infrastructures (Tilson et al. 2010, Henfridsson and Bygstad 2013) and the availability of smartphones as a delivery mechanism (Lyytinen and Yoo 2002) radically lowered the entry barriers for entrepreneurs to pursue unprecedented market opportunities through digital innovation.

The research commentary by Yoo et al. (2010) arguably served as a catalyst for the interest in digital innovation among IS scholars. Defining digital innovation as "the carrying out of new combinations of digital and physical components to produce novel products" (Yoo et al. 2010, p. 725), it offered two key ideas that enabled scholars to frame and study the unique nature and consequences of digital innovation.

First, it described the specification of a technology architecture through which innovation is enabled and markets are transformed. In particular, the LMA advances the notion of four distinct layers—hardware, software, content, and network—as separate value spaces of innovation (cf. Henfridsson et al. 2018). Second, it put forward the incessant recombination as the driving force of digital innovation. Combined with the accessibility of digital technologies as the primary means of digital innovation and the historically low cost of capital, these two forces—the separation of four layers and recombination—allowed researchers to explore new forms of value creation far beyond the traditional vertical industrial and product boundaries.

Some 15 years later, digital innovation has come of age. Consider how digital innovation has transformed industries, reshaped economies, and altered our lives and work. We navigate with Google Maps, share memories on Instagram, work remotely via Zoom, shop endlessly on Amazon, and stay connected through Facebook. From LinkedIn for professional networking to X (formerly Twitter) for real-time updates, from Dropbox for file storage to Venmo for seamless transactions, and from Fitbit for fitness to Headspace for mindfulness, digital tools permeate every aspect of our lives, reshaping the way we connect, learn, and grow.

Apple, Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and Meta are among the world's most valuable companies, boasting trillions of dollars of market capitalization. The advent of the gig economy, fueled by companies like Uber, Airbnb, and Etsy, has disrupted traditional employment models and created new opportunities for millions of people worldwide. Most recently, hardware companies like Nvidia have enabled other companies to accelerate digital innovation further by supplying technologies that enable parallel computation. For the most part, the IS community has been at the forefront of researching this digital innovation revolution.

Yet, it is clear that our current society does not readily map to the positive image envisioned by Yoo et al. (2010). Even though the past 15 years have indeed unleashed a wave of generative innovations, the lion's share of the value created has been captured by a handful of big tech platforms that have mastered and exploited the inner workings of digital infrastructure. Although we, people in our everyday contexts, enjoy free, convenient, and almost abundant digital services, we pay for these "free" services with the data we create through our attention and actions.

The early promise of democratizing innovation through the unbounded generativity of digital technology has been tamed by the iron grip of the few companies, often referred to as the Magnificent Seven. The most recent court ruling on Google's monopoly case is just the tip of the iceberg (United States of America et al. v. Google LLC 2024). Moreover, as these technologies have expanded, concerns have emerged, in turn, about their unintended negative consequences for society, from the unsustainable level of electricity demands to power data centers and generative artificial intelligence (AI) (Watson et al. 2010) to the amplification of fake news (Muchnik et al. 2013, Kitchens et al. 2020) and declines in youth mental health associated with the use of social media platforms like Instagram and TikTok (Krasnova et al. 2015).

**Addressing the apparent chasm between the early vision of unbridled value creation of digital innovation and the reality 15 years later of the negative consequences of digital innovation is the grand challenge that the global information systems research community must confront.** The power of digital innovation is too ubiquitous, its reach too pervasive, and its impact too consequential for our community to stand on the sidelines and passively document what happens. The urgency of this challenge serves as the impetus for this editorial.

## 2. Digital Innovation: Background, Current Status, and Limitations

### 2.1. Background

In the aftermath of the dot.com bubble, the world saw decisive and irreversible changes driven by digital technology. As observed by Friedman (2017), the launch and breakthrough of the iPhone, Hadoop, GitHub, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Android, Kindle, Airbnb, and IBM Watson, among many other significant innovations, roughly happened when internet users hit 1 billion in late 2006. Given these breathtaking innovations, the promises of the early visions of computing seemed to have finally arrived. Computers were no longer just tools for work in the office, but became integral parts of our daily lives (Weiser 1991, Dourish 2001, Yoo 2010).

Until then, information technology (IT) was a tool to support business. IT had to align with the business to support its strategic goal (Henderson and Venkatraman 1999). To wit, IT was not the business; it was merely a tool to support it. However, all of that changed this century. Now, IT has become the business. It started with early digital native companies like Google, Amazon, and Facebook, selling digital goods. These digital goods were not subject to the economic rules of the physical goods of traditional firms (Shapiro and Varian 1999). Over time, however, the barrier between digital and physical goods blurred with the introduction of smartphones, the Internet of Things, and mobile communications.

### 2.2. Current Status

The term "digital" started to emerge in our discourse as a meaningful signifier some 15 years ago. Early works by Yoo et al. (2010), Yoo (2013), Faulkner and Runde (2013, 2019), Kallinikos et al. (2010, 2013), and Leonardi (2010) offer contributions that speak to digital innovation. This early body of work emphasizes reprogrammable, recombinable, ephemeral, and ambivalent characteristics of digital objects that enable the procrastinated and temporary binding of digital resources for new market offerings (Lehmann et al. 2022), generativity (Yoo et al. 2012, Fürstenau et al. 2023), rapid scaling (Huang et al. 2017), and, eventually, the establishment of digital platform ecosystems (Parker et al. 2016, Jacobides et al. 2018).

A series of conceptual breakthroughs came when scholars began articulating digital objects' properties. Two contributions stand out:

1. **Faulkner and Runde (2013, 2019)** conceptualize digital objects, such as software applications and data files, as essentially nonmaterial, bitstring-based objects that contrast with the spatial attributes associated with physical objects. Nonmaterial objects of this sort nonetheless have an enduring structure and are variously entangled with material bearers (e.g., hard-disks, CD-ROMs), through which they are stored, shared, and acted upon.

2. **Kallinikos et al. (2010, 2013)** elaborate on digital objects as **editable, interactive, open, and distributed**. These properties challenge the conventional notions of stability, boundedness, and closure that have characterized most artifacts in the past. Moreover, they suggest that digital objects are not only different from physical objects, but also from other types of symbolic or informational objects, such as texts, images, or sounds.

In parallel to these works seeking to define digital objects and their unique features, **Yoo et al. (2010)** expound on how embedding digital components into previously physical products changes the nature of products, value creation, and the organizing logic. Building on two foundational theories in computer science—von Neumann's theory of the stored-program computer (later known as von Neumann Architecture) (von Neumann 1945) and Claude Shannon's digital signal theory (Shannon 1948)—they highlight two critical separations in product architecture as a consequence of digital innovation.

These separations give rise to two fundamental properties of digital technology:

1. **Reprogrammability**: Building on von Neumann's computing architecture, the separation of hardware and software leads to reprogrammability. This means that the functionality of a digital device can be changed by modifying its software without altering the physical hardware.

2. **Data Homogenization**: Building on Shannon's digital signal theory, the separation between network and content leads all types of content—texts, images, and sound—to be homogenized into bits. The separation between data and content is a fundamental prerequisite of the ongoing data revolution, as it allows different types of data to be transmitted, stored, and processed and combined using the same digital infrastructure (Gleick 2011, Alaimo and Kallinikos 2024).

Furthermore, Yoo et al. (2010) note the **self-referential nature of digital technology**; digital innovation requires digital technology. They argue that the self-referential nature of digital innovation creates a virtuous cycle through the positive externalities of the diffusion of digital technology.

### 2.3. Limitations of Digital Innovation to Date

Given the early excitement about the potential of distributed and generative digital innovation, mainly stressing the shift of the locus of value creation as a positive force for industrial organizing logic (Yoo et al. 2010), it is important to re-examine these early assumptions and projections to understand ways by which current economy and society do not necessarily map onto the reality envisioned.

We see at least three distinct, yet related, aspects of digital innovation that can serve as entry points to understanding the limitations of digital innovation research:

## Table 1. Re-examination of Early Assumptions and Visions of Digital Innovation

| Key Ideas | We Thought Then | Yes, But |
|-----------|-----------------|----------|
| **Distributed, generative, and recombinant innovation through LMA** | Four distinct layers creating separate value spaces with system-agnostic digital components, which enables distributed and generative innovation through recombinations. Industry and product boundaries blurred. Shift of value creation from corporations to individuals and entrepreneurs. | Disproportionate value capture by few big tech platforms. Centralized control over key digital resources. |
| **Positive network externalities** | Positive externalities driving innovation. Enhanced platform capabilities. | New form of externalities, data network effect. Negative demand-side externalities (e.g., overcrowding, privacy concerns, entry barriers, and gatekeeping). Need for careful examination of centralized LMA used by dominant platforms. |
| **Data as the center stage of digital innovation** | Homogenization of all data as a part of LMA's content layer. Data as new economic resources through learning effect. Data as the medium or vehicle by which innovation occurs. | Centrality of data in value creation; data as an independent value source rather than enabler. Privacy concerns and data exploitation. Data perform epistemic, semantic, and communicative functions with far-reaching work, industry, and structural implications. |

### Three Key Limitations

**First**, recombination in layered modular architecture turns out to be subject to far more centralized control than originally imagined. Consider that, in modular systems, control is codified in the interfaces between components (Baldwin and Clark 2000, Lee and Berente 2012), and whoever has control over significant boundary resources (Ghazawneh and Henfridsson 2013) will also dominate the value spaces related to layers of digital innovation (Woodard 2008, Um et al. 2023, Benzell et al. 2024). The centralized control of key digital resources involved in the distributed value creation process can lead to uneven value distribution among participating actors.

**Second**, initially, the architectural view of digital innovation, represented by LMA, ran in parallel with the economic view of digital platform ecosystems, which view them as multisided markets (Rochet and Tirole 2003, Parker and Van Alstyne 2005). However, the demand-side externalities, which have been less explored, can have profound implications, such as negative consequences associated with undesirable outcomes like overcrowding, gatekeeping, diminished user experience, and privacy concerns.

**Third**, data have become a critical frontier in digital innovation. Although the LMA provides a framework for understanding content and its intersections with other layers of digital innovation, there is a growing recognition that value creation does not necessarily happen via the recombination of system-agnostic components alone. Rather, data homogenization and the aggregation and recombination of different types of data enable these platforms to create and capture value along diverse value paths (Baskerville et al. 2020, Gregory et al. 2021, Alaimo and Kallinikos 2022).

What connects these three aspects is the growing recognition of seemingly irreconcilable tension between digital innovation's incredible value creation possibilities and decisively distorted value distribution among participating actors.

## 3. Digital Innovation: Moving Forward

A central tension emerging from our reflection on the past 15 years is the irreconcilable chasm between the massive value created from distributed, generative, and recombinant innovations and the disproportionately uneven distribution of value created among actors. Thus, a compelling intellectual challenge that our field must confront is vigorous intellectual inquiries on how to resolve this tension efficiently, fairly, and sustainably.

Our analysis highlights three aspects of digital innovation serving as complementary entry points to address this challenge: 
- (a) the centralization of control over digital architectures
- (b) the impact of negative externalities leading to market concentration
- (c) the emergence of data as a critical driver of value and organizational change

These three dimensions represent complex tensions between the architectural, economic, and epistemic dimensions of digital innovation.

## Table 2. Emerging Research Themes and Example Research Questions

### 3.1. Decentering Architectural Control in Modularity and Recombinant Innovation

Recombination is essential to innovation (Schumpeter 1983, Arthur 2009). Innovation is about combining ideas, tools, and practices, established and new, into a product or service that creates value in a novel way. Bitcoin combines existing functions, such as the transaction timestamp, hashing, and distributed ledgers. It excels over many other attempts to establish digital cash among computer scientists and cryptographers by combining established functions in a novel and powerful way (Baucherel 2020).

Since Simon (1962, p. 468) observed that a complex adaptive system is "one made up of a large number of parts that interact in a non-simple way," decomposition and recombination of modules have been key to innovation strategies (Parnas 1972, Baldwin and Clark 2000). Such decomposition and modularization rely on interfaces to resolve potential conflicts among the complex system's interacting parts (Ulrich 1995, Sanchez and Mahoney 1996).

#### Digital Innovations Upended the Traditional Model

Unlike the traditional modular architecture of physical products that follow the inherent hierarchical structure of system components (Clark 1985), Yoo et al. (2010) argue that digital components in LMA are fundamentally system-agnostic, even though, in practice, there may be limits on how far such components can be used across systems. With well-established interfaces of service-oriented architecture and cloud-based computing infrastructure, digital platforms defied the core assumption of traditional logic (Fishman and McLarty 2024).

Instead of focusing on a single design hierarchy tightly controlled by a focal firm, companies like SalesForce, Google, and Amazon built their businesses by providing system-agnostic, programmable, and recombinatorial digital components to third-party developers. Amazon Web Services (AWS) and the entire software-as-a-service (SaaS) industry are built on this premise.

Jeff Bezos, in his famous Bezos's mandate, wrote:

> All teams will henceforth expose their data and functionality through service interfaces. Teams must communicate with each other through these interfaces. There will be no other form of interprocess communication allowed: no direct linking, no direct reads of another team's data store, no shared-memory model, no back-doors whatsoever. The only communication allowed is via service interface calls over the network...All service interfaces, without exception, must be designed from the ground up to be externalizable. That is to say, the team must plan and design to be able to expose the interface to developers in the outside world. No exceptions. (quoted in Iansiti and Lakhani 2020, p. 79)

#### Research Opportunities Moving Forward

**First**, scholars should investigate how the locus of control of the interfaces and overall layered modular architecture influence how value is created and captured. The starting point here is to make a distinction between **decentralization** and **distribution**. Although we have witnessed a significant distribution of innovation activities through the generative power of LMA, the control of digital innovation has not been distributed (Dixon 2024). In fact, one can argue that the control has become even more centralized than ever before.

Now, we are seeing the emergence of a broad spectrum of decentralized web technologies (also known as Web 3.0), challenging the hegemony of distributed web technologies (also known as Web 2.0). These decentralized web technologies enable decentralizing the control of interfaces, user identities, and execution of protocols, among others. We argue that the convergence of decentralization and LMA will help us address some of the negative consequences of the current LMA with centralized controls.

**Second**, no digital innovations are created in a vacuum. They are outcomes of deliberate human actions and choices. Therefore, one must carefully examine the socio-technical design of decentralized web technologies. Some platform providers opt to envelop popular third-party modules on their platforms by tightly coupling those into their core modules (Eisenmann et al. 2011, Zhu and Iansiti 2012). The decisions made by platform providers regarding the coupling of modules or the design of interfaces have far-reaching consequences, yet our understanding of these design practices remains limited.

### 3.2. Externalities

Given the dominance of platform-based settings in prior work on digital innovation (Tiwana et al. 2010, Yoo et al. 2012) and the unique growth dynamics of digital platforms in terms of "rapid scaling" (Huang et al. 2017), the literature in this domain has a close connection to the notion of **network externalities** (also referred to as network effects), which helps explain the exponential growth of digital platforms from an economic perspective.

#### Data Network Effects

Expanding the notion of network effects, the concept of **data network effects** has recently emerged as a theoretical device to understand the role of data through the network lens, where the value of a network or platform increases as the ecosystem gains more data above and beyond the pure network effects. Data network effects is an emerging category of network effects focusing on the phenomenon that a user's utility of a platform is not only a function of the network, but also of data-driven learning and improvements realized with AI (Gregory et al. 2022, Hagiu and Wright 2023).

For example, in Amazon's advertising network, Amazon leverages its massive data, which include users' browsing history, search records, and purchase behaviors, to target customers within its ecosystem. Individual vendors participating in Amazon's ecosystem enjoy the network effects of Amazon's scale and the power of its sophisticated AI system that helps target Amazon customers in a way that they cannot do otherwise.

#### Negative Externalities

However, externalities are not always positive; what can be positive for the platform owner may have negative implications for users and society. **Negative externalities** refer to situations wherein the private marginal cost of an action is lower than its public marginal cost, leading to overproduction relative to a welfare-maximizing ideal (Pigou 1924, Coase 1960).

At the individual level, these include:
- Consumer lock-in (Bursztyn et al. 2023)
- Digital addiction (Allcott et al. 2022)
- Choice overload (Tucker 2018)
- Overcrowding (Boudreau and Jeppesen 2015, Halaburda et al. 2018)
- Privacy violation (Acquisti 2022)

At the societal level, they include:
- Anticompetitive behavior (Khan 2017)
- Polarization (Boxell et al. 2017)
- Environmental costs (Istrate et al. 2024)

#### Research Paths Forward

**First**, scholars must investigate different forms of negative externalities of digital innovation and estimate the true cost and value of digital innovation at all levels for all stakeholders.

**Second**, building on a large body of work in economics and public policy, scholars must scrutinize the efficacy of different regulatory approaches for addressing these negative externalities. For example, the Digital Market Act, the Digital Services Act, and the General Data Protection Regulation have been passed in Europe, and the AI Act remains under discussion (Wheeler 2024).

**Third**, it is crucial to explore new ways by which these negative externalities can be minimized. The governance and control mechanisms that platforms decide to implement can also have far-reaching consequences, extending beyond the platform itself.

### 3.3. Data, Knowledge, and Organizational Change

The ideas put forward so far suggest that the link of data to innovation has largely remained implicit in the digital innovation literature. Data and data management continued until recently to be viewed as background operations necessary to support the smooth execution of tasks. It was only in the last 10 or 15 years that data came to be widely understood as an important source of value and a driver of organizational and economic transformation.

#### Data as Drivers of Organizational Change

Several themes in the recent literature spin around the functions that data perform in organizations:

1. **Digital Monitoring and Tracking**: The advancement of powerful digital sensors and ubiquitous digital connectivity allows organizations to digitize tasks and processes, track the organizational use of resources, and monitor performance across several operations at scale.

2. **Comparative Analysis**: Digital data can be relied upon to establish comparisons across task groups, products, settings, and periods.

3. **Predictive Capabilities**: Digital data can be used to draw predictions about future occurrences and possibly prescribe desirable courses of action.

4. **Strategic Medium**: From this perspective, data become a critical medium for strategy formulation. Combined with a variety of external data sources, internal data acquire new value and can be used to spot market trends, establish comparisons within and across industries, and analyze competitive conditions.

#### Data and Expertise Transformation

The understanding of data as drivers of managerial and economic restructuring has been paralleled by research on the impact of data on organizational learning, expert knowledge, and the eventual reshaping of expertise (Abbasi et al. 2016, Jarvenpaa and Markus 2018, Parmiggiani and Monteiro 2019, Aaltonen et al. 2021).

This nascent literature shows that the diffusion of data makes available novel sources of evidence that shift attention to new objects of work and redefine the patterns by which knowledge is generated and expertise is exercised. For instance, data from social media and other online settings can be drawn upon to shape such diverse fields of expertise as:
- Legal practice (Ashley 2017)
- Policing or criminal detection (Waardenburg et al. 2022)
- Healthcare (Kallinikos and Tempini 2014)
- Finance (Begenau et al. 2018)

#### The AI Revolution and Data

The links of data to innovation, expertise, and structural change have lately been recast by the march of artificial intelligence, the advance of deep learning, and, more recently, the diffusion of large language models (LLMs). The importance of data grows as AI diffuses throughout the economy and society. Data are massively drawn upon to set up and train AI-based systems and technologies.

All AI training essentially depends on data that the neural networks of AI learn to assemble to recognizable objects (e.g., object or face recognition) and cultural outputs, as with LLMs (Mitchell 2019, Smith 2019). The exigencies of making sense of reality by machines are nonetheless such that the tasks that AI systems perform must pass through the relentless analytic decomposition of areas of life (image, audio, text, haptic information) into massive subconceptual or subperceptual data fields that the AI systems learn to recompose by recourse to statistical and data management techniques.

These observations indicate that whenever they are used, deep learning and LLMs are prone to set up a **disembodied, computationally anchored system of cognition** that is essentially different from the prevailing social practices of cognition, knowledge development, learning, and expertise (Yoo 2024).

#### Emerging Concerns and Ethical Questions

An emerging body of early empirical work has raised concerns that AI technologies, when leveraged in creative, evaluative, and decision-oriented tasks, may lead to the **homogenization of behavior and outcomes** (Kleinberg and Raghavan 2021, Anderson et al. 2022, Doshi and Hauser 2024, Zhou and Lee 2024).

Making data a pervasive element of expert practices raises serious ethical questions regarding how data are generated, collected, shared, verified, aggregated, and used (Chatterjee and Sarker 2013). These matters reverberate on the accountability of decisions that span from defining data dictionaries and ontology, shaping data standards to patterns of aggregating and using data to train AI models.

## 4. Concluding Reflections

> [W]e'll soon be able to work with AI that helps us accomplish much more than we ever could without AI; eventually we can each have a personal AI team, full of virtual experts in different areas, working together to create almost anything we can imagine. Our children will have virtual tutors who can provide personalized instruction in any subject, in any language, and at whatever pace they need. We can imagine similar ideas for better healthcare, the ability to create any kind of software someone can imagine, and much more.
> 
> With these new abilities, we can have shared prosperity to a degree that seems unimaginable today; in the future, everyone's lives can be better than anyone's life is now. Prosperity alone doesn't necessarily make people happy—there are plenty of miserable rich people—but it would meaningfully improve the lives of people around the world.

The promise of digital innovation endures, now fueled by the seemingly magical power of AI. Daring visions abound: cancers cured, poverty vanquished, universal happiness within reach. Yet, a starkly different reality unfolds: data rights violated, rare earth materials depleted by child labor, unseen workers exploited to train AI models. Energy and water consumption soar, threatening our climate and well-being. The fruits of innovation are disproportionately enjoyed by a privileged few. Valuable knowledge and expertise are sidelined or redefined, with consequences still unknown. Technology advances, yet the promises and problems remain, stubborn as ever.

**Digital innovation research is standing at a crossroads.** The power of digital technology continues to grow, and the scope of its application expands. And so do the potential negative consequences of digital technology. With the exponentially growing power of AI, this will only accelerate (Aschenbrenner 2024); we see opportunities for IS scholars to continue to engage with this topic for the foreseeable future.

But the opportunities come with responsibilities. Our scholarly work cannot just settle on the status quo. Our work should strive to shape the future. We can continue to be a part of the problem or choose to contribute to solutions. It is in this spirit that we offer ways forward for our community, shifting our attention from unbounded generative digital innovation to a more balanced and responsible one.

### Our Call to Action

We call for:

1. **More research on value capture and allocation** among different stakeholders in the digital ecosystem
2. **Balanced attention to both the positive and negative externalities** of digital innovations
3. **Deeper engagement with data** as the fundamental components of the digital ecosystem, not just as technical objects, but also as social, cognitive, and epistemic ones

### The Role of Ethics

Some sharp-eyed readers might wonder why we do not have a separate section on ethics. Simply put, **it is too important to be limited to a single section.** Instead, we try to integrate ethical concerns and issues that scholars must consider for each of the three highlighted areas.

In 2019, one of us was asked by a leading global electronic manufacturer to study the "next big thing" by interviewing 15 global technologists. Surprisingly, **ethical technology** was the top response of every expert we interviewed. Many reflected that technologists often focus on the functional performance of technology, leaving ethical and social issues to others. However, experts interviewed argue that **ethics must be directly baked into technology design**.

### Balancing Technology and Social Understanding

Just like technologists cannot ignore ethical and social issues, **IS scholars cannot continue to step around technology**. Too often, we complain that colleagues from other management fields do not appreciate technology, yet our scholarship does not reflect technology's complex and rich details either.

Although we jump to notice the role of power, identity, and other familiar social constructs in light of new technologies, such as large language models in organizations, few bother to delve into the technology deeply enough to understand precisely how the new technology is different from previous as it interacts with social variables. This is a tricky balance, as we do not want to turn our work into descriptive technical work. It is a balance, nevertheless, that we must strive to achieve.

### Theoretical and Methodological Evolution

With these new challenges, we must embrace new theoretical foundations (Grover and Lyytinen 2015, 2023). The evolutionary and precarious nature of digital objects, the complex and evolving nature of digital ecosystems, and the increasingly semantic nature of digital communication demand fresh theoretical perspectives that can deal with evolution, temporality, ecology, complexity, liminality, and agency.

We also need to embrace new methodologies. Scholars increasingly use various forms of computational tools to leverage large-scale trace data (Lazer et al. 2009, Berente et al. 2019, Miranda et al. 2022, Zhang et al. 2022). Notwithstanding these new theories and methods, we need more interdisciplinary and intradisciplinary collaborations.

### A Cautionary but Optimistic Note

We end our editorial on a cautionary note. We write this editorial in part because of our collective sense that the early vision of digital innovation was a mirage. Although we successfully foresaw the generative and creative potential of digital resources, we see firms that are bigger, more powerful, and more consequential. That led us to believe that the new frontiers of digital innovations involve being aware of and actively engaging with the potential negative consequences of digital innovation.

However, **we do not intend to promote an alarmist view**. To the contrary, we maintain a fundamentally optimistic perspective on technology's potential to create societal value while recognizing the significant work required to ensure fair and equitable distribution of that value.

**We believe it is possible to create conditions of future digital innovation where the power of generative and distributed value creation of digital innovation is combined with a more balanced and fair distribution of value created and social justice.** Such a future will demand the mobilization of our collective intellectual curiosity and creativity to study the design, deployment, use, and regulation of novel technology architecture and digital resources that promote more human-centered and ethical choices by all actors involved in the digital innovation practice.

Although we acknowledge the importance of regulation in addressing market failures and protecting societal interests, we also believe that nuanced, human-centered, responsibly designed technological innovations themselves can play essential roles in addressing challenges.

All in all, **the field of digital innovation continues to present rich opportunities for impactful research**. We hope that this editorial and the emerging frontiers outlined above will stimulate scholars to contribute valuable insights that can guide the development of more equitable and sustainable digital futures.
