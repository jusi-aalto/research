**Abstract:**  
By working with and through the paradoxes present in the resource-based view (RBV) of strategic management, scholars can advance understanding concerning the contradictions and tensions inherent in creating and sustaining superior firm performance. We identify and discuss various RBV paradoxes illustrating how paradoxical thinking can enhance theorizing and open up new vistas for knowing and understanding. Finally, we discuss the utility of the paradoxical perspective in furthering RBV scholarship.

Paradox, “the dynamic tensions of juxtaposed opposites” (Rosen, 1994: xvii), underpins much organization and management scholarship and practice. The use of paradox can promote divergent or “oppositional” thinking (Cameron, 1986; Rothenberg, 1976; Schumacher, 1977), cultivate interest (Davis, 1971; Weick, 1979), and increase a theory’s “generative potency” (DiMaggio, 1995; Gergen, 1978). Furthermore, researchers and business executives have noted that organizational life is full of paradoxes (Bouchikhi, 1998; Mitroff, 1995). And if, as some have claimed, the business environment is characterized by growing complexity and turbulence (Handy, 1994; Price Waterhouse Change Integration Team, 1996), companies may succeed or fail based on differences in their capabilities to manage paradox.

The resource-based view (RBV) of strategic management provides a theoretical lens to examine how firms manage paradox. Based on the premise that heterogeneous, hard-to-copy resources and capabilities provide the basis of strategic advantage and superior firm performance, the RBV has stimulated a great deal of interest among scholars in strategic management (Amit & Schoemaker, 1993; Barney, 1991; Conner, 1991; Peteraf, 1993; Rumelt, 1984) and in related fields, such as human resource management (Lado & Wilson, 1994; Wright & McMahan, 1992), operations management (Cox, 1996), marketing (Hunt, 2000; Hunt & Morgan, 1995), and management information systems (Bharadwaj, 2000; Mata, Fuerst, & Barney, 1995). Scholars have refined and extended the RBV’s core tenets to explain how dynamic capabilities (Dyer & Singh, 1998; Teece, Pisano, & Shuen, 1997) and processes of knowledge development and use (Grant, 1996; Nonaka, 1994; Spender, 1996) generate sustainable strategic advantage. Further, synergies of scholarship have accrued from integration of RBV insights with ideas derived from organizational economics (Mahoney & Pandian, 1992), population ecology theory (Barnett, Greve, & Park, 1994), institutionalization theory (Oliver, 1997), and organizational learning theory (Lei, Hitt, & Bettis, 1996), among others.

Critics, however, view RBV logic as paradoxical, infused with contradictions and ambiguities. RBV logic, they argue, has produced seemingly incompatible implications for managerial scholarship and practice (Priem & Butler, 2001). For example, RBV logic suggests that the ability to measure a resource means that this resource will be less likely to be a source of sustained competitive advantage. Also, this logic suggests that there cannot be “rules for riches,” yet it can be used to generate managerial prescriptions concerning how firms can achieve strategic advantage through their resource deployments. Causal ambiguity—the relative difficulty of deciphering causal links between organizational resources and outcomes (Lippman & Rumelt, 1982)—suggests that managers are limited in their ability to understand the sources of sustained competitive advantage.

Critics point to these paradoxes, along with problems of unfalsifiability, tautology, and the potential for infinite regress, as evidence that the RBV is hopelessly irredeemable. Apparently, they subscribe to a traditional view of science (e.g., Brown, 1977; Chalmers, 1999), which holds that the presence of paradox within a theory undermines its scientific utility and diminishes its ability to guide managerial scholarship and practice (Collis, 1994; Foss, 1996; Porter, 1991; Priem & Butler, 2001). Other researchers, however, have capitalized on these criticisms by seeking to “resolve” the paradoxes in order to generate new theoretical insights (e.g., Kogut & Zander, 1996; Leonard-Barton, 1992; Miller & Shamsie, 1996).

In this article we take a different approach. Our overarching claim is that, as a theoretical perspective, the RBV is attuned to addressing the paradoxical challenges of creating and sustaining superior firm performance. This claim is grounded in an alternative view holding that paradox in scientific inquiry is “intrinsic and indelible” (Poundstone, 1988: 18). Some of the RBV paradoxes might reflect endogenous factors—that is, they are embedded in RBV logic itself, reflecting the paradoxical nature of theory building and science (e.g., Poundstone, 1988; Rosen, 1994). Additionally, other RBV paradoxes might reflect exogenous factors—that is, the paradoxes within the theory enable scholars to explore and gain a better understanding of our surrounding world (e.g., DiMaggio, 1995; Quinn & Cameron, 1988; Starbuck, 1988). Thus, we identify and explain various RBV paradoxes and discuss how their use can foster knowledge and understanding.

In developing our ideas, we seek a “complicated’ understanding” (Bartunek, Gordon, & Weathersby, 1983) of the process of theorizing, rather than a simple model of a complex and paradoxical reality. As the principle of requisite variety (Ashby, 1960) suggests, complex managerial practice in contemporary organizations calls for complex modes of theorizing (Casti, 1994; Tsoukas & Hatch, 2001). Our discussion of RBV paradoxes begins to address a concern that “we are confronting some kind of postmodern paradox,” which requires us “to seek out new approaches to theorizing” and generate new understanding for the field of strategic management (Spender & Grant, 1996: 9). After providing a conceptual background, we identify and discuss a number of RBV paradoxes with a view toward fostering greater understanding. Finally, we discuss the utility of the paradoxical perspective in furthering RBV scholarship.

## Paradox: A Conceptual Background

Organization and management scholars have argued that the use of paradox can engender understanding by enabling scholars to address logical contradictions (or conundrums) in a theory and to identify tensions and oppositions in order to develop more encompassing theories (Poole & Van de Ven, 1989). Working with paradox can foster self-reflexivity and promote conversation among scholars and managers (Morgan, 1983; Zald, 1996). Thus, paradoxes may serve as useful conceptual tools that extend our capabilities beyond the limits imposed by formal logic (Ford & Backoff, 1988; Starbuck, 1988). To foreshadow our arguments concerning the role of paradox in theorizing within the RBV, we provide a brief overview of extant conceptualizations of paradox, followed by a discussion of paradox in philosophy of science.

### Extant Conceptualizations of Paradox

The term paradox has been conceptualized in different ways, including formal/logical, informal/ordinary language, and rhetorical. These conceptualizations might reflect the different “language games” that people play when they perceive complex and incongruous phenomena (Wittgenstein, 1953). Table 1 summarizes various definitions of paradox and their applications in organization and management studies.

**Table 1**  
**Paradox: Definitions and Uses/Applications in Organization and Management Studies**

| Type of Paradox | Definition (Source) | Examples of Application in Organization and Management Studies |
|-----------------|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| Formal/logical | Two contrary or even contradictory propositions to which we are led by apparently sound arguments (van Heigenoort, 1972) | Poole and Van de Ven (1989) use logical paradox as a “touchstone” for analyzing the action-structure tension in organization and management studies. |
| Informal/ordinary language | “Used loosely, as an informal umbrella for interesting and thought-provoking contradictions of all sorts” (Poole & Van de Ven, 1999: 563) | - Hatch and Ehrlich (1997) use spontaneous humor (or irony) to explain how individuals cope with paradox and ambiguity in organizational life.<br>- Lewis (2000) explores paradoxes of organizing.<br>- Sundaramurthy and Lewis (2003) discuss the paradoxes of corporate governance.<br>- Stohl and Cheney (2001) discuss various paradoxes of participation in organizational work teams.<br>- Farson (1996) illustrates how apparent absurdities could be the sources of managerial competencies.<br>- Eylon and Allison (2002) empirically demonstrate how people in organizations are more willing to share ambiguous information with collaborators than with competitors. |
| Rhetorical/literary criticism | “A conclusion or apodosis contrary to what the audience has been led up to expect” (Oxford English Dictionary Online, 2003). | - Krdas and Smircich (1999) and Kilduff and Mehra (1997) suggest postmodernist or poststructuralist approaches to theorizing designed to expose contradictions in modernist theories grounded in positivist logic.<br>- Weick (1999) calls for greater self-reflexivity in theorizing.<br>- Zald (1996) suggests that researchers engage in “enlightened” conversation. |

Some scholars adopt a single definition of paradox to enhance precision (e.g., Lewis, 2000); others use a combination of definitions to generate a richer understanding of organizational phenomena (Poole & Van de Ven, 1989). Taking the latter approach, we use paradox in three ways: formal/logical, informal/ordinary language, and rhetorical uses. We use paradox in the logical sense to address epistemological issues surrounding RBV logic, such as problems of unfalsifiability, tautology, and infinite regress. Also, because strategic management is a pragmatic field, we use paradox in the informal or “ordinary language” sense to understand how actors make sense of apparent contradictions, oppositions, and ambiguities encountered in work contexts. Finally, insofar as theorizing is a discursive enterprise (Poole & Van de Ven, 1989), we use paradox in the rhetorical sense to open up new (different) vistas for knowledge and knowing, and with a view to fostering productive inquiry (Cook & Brown, 1999). Together, these three uses of paradox provide an integrative and holistic understanding of RBV phenomena.

### Paradox in Philosophy of Science

In order to fully appreciate the role of paradox in theorizing in the RBV, it is necessary to consider the role of paradox in philosophy of science. As noted above, the criticism that RBV logic contains paradoxes that diminish its explanatory power might be rooted in the traditional view of scientific inquiry, which holds that paradoxes are anathema to scientific inquiry (Brown, 1977; Whitehead & Russell, 1927). This view, however, has been vigorously challenged by “natural” (e.g., Chargaff, 1977; Heisenberg, 1958) and social (e.g., Kaplan, 1964; Luhmann, 1990; Merton, 1976) scientists, by philosophers of science (e.g., Gödel, 1970; Goodman & Elgin, 1988; Hofstadter, 1979), and by those who study the practice of science (e.g., Harding, 1991; Latour, 1987). Taken together, their work suggests, alternatively, that “science is based on deliberately created [paradoxical] contradictions” (Teunissen, 1996: 17).

Within an alternative view of science, paradox forces investigators to “think twice” about taken-for-granted assumptions about reality, truth, and knowledge (Krippendorff, 1984; Quine, 1976). Working with paradox enables scholars to seek “truth, often with the knowledge that they will not attain it” (Chargaff, 1977: 21). As Kurt Gödel (1970) demonstrates, statements exist that can neither be derived from a set of mathematical axioms nor consistently proven to be either true or false. Furthermore, what constitutes the truth depends on the “language games” that people use to construct or make sense of their reality (Berger & Luckman, 1967; Wittgenstein, 1953). Insofar as “truth resides no place, yet everywhere” (Dunnette, 1970; cited in McCall & Bobko, 1990: 381), the search for truth is ongoing. Such a search might generate greater knowledge, as well as greater ignorance. In other words, “the more we know, the less we know” (Chargaff, 1977: 5). Thus, notions such as reality, truth, knowledge, and progress are proximal rather than distal (Goodman & Elgin, 1988; Lakatos, 1976, 1978), reflecting our relationships with and in our world (Berman, 1984).

Within this view, knowledge is understood both as a cause and an effect, a state as well as a flow (Snowden, 2002), reflecting how the content of knowledge and the context of knowing are inextricably intertwined (e.g., Cook & Brown, 1999). Understanding knowledge simultaneously as cause and effect challenges the traditional positivist thinking that emphasizes knowledge as an object that can be independently “discovered” through the scientific method and that relegates “subjective” knowledge to art and philosophy (Chalmers, 1999). Instead, a paradoxical view of knowledge suggests that “what is a cause can only be identified as such in the process of effecting ‘something’ that by the same token can only be identified as ‘effect’ in ... conjunction with ‘something’ that produced it” (Fischer, 2003: 32). Furthermore, the notion of scientific progress is viewed not as a linear movement toward a certain and final truth but as a dialectical process of oppositions, contradictions, and conflicts, the resolution of which gives rise to yet other paradoxes at more complex levels (Rosen, 1994; Whitehead, 1978).

This view of scientific progress is accentuated in the work of Imre Lakatos (1976, 1978). Lakatos (1978) proposed a “methodology of scientific research programs” (MSRP) that sought to reorient the conversation on falsification, which was dominated by Popper (Chalmers, 1999). Lakatos’s MSRP offers a synthesis of competing accounts of scientific progress—reflected in Popper’s (1959), Kuhn’s (1970), and Feyerabend’s (1988) accounts, among others—into a coherent (if paradoxical) framework for understanding the growth of scientific theories. Within this framework, Lakatos notes that the “demarcation between the soft, unproven ‘theories’ and the hard, proven ‘empirical basis’ is non-existent: all propositions of science are theoretical and, incurably, fallible” (1978: 16). He proposes “sophisticated” falsification (as opposed to Popperian “naive” falsification) as a better basis for appraising scientific knowledge or truth claims insofar as it enables the testing of a system of competing theories within the research program. These auxiliary hypotheses form a protective belt around the hard core of the research program. This hard core, consisting of a set of facts, ideas, or propositions that have come to be taken for granted by scientists working within the research program, is immune to falsification attempts. Researchers may focus on augmenting the hard core of the research program by increasing its theoretical content, making it capable of anticipating novel phenomena.

Contrary to naive falsificationists, Lakatos argues that there is no falsification before the emergence of a better theory, yet a better theory cannot emerge if all theoretical statements have to bear the brunt of falsification. In Lakatos’s system, scientific progress results from ongoing dialectical interplays among multiple and competing theories within an “organic” research program. As we discuss later in the paper, Lakatos’s ideas may be used to illustrate how a “budding” research program such as the RBV can become progressive.

## RBV Paradoxes

In this section we examine logical conundrums, as well as ordinary language and rhetorical sources of paradox within the RBV. On the surface, these paradoxes appear to be resolvable, for example, through temporal or spatial separation (Poole & Van de Ven, 1989). Yet such resolution may uncover deeper-level contradictions or tensions underpinning RBV epistemology.

Our discussion is intended to be illustrative rather than exhaustive. The discussion of logical conundrums serves to illustrate our claim that some of the RBV paradoxes reflect the paradoxes inherent in scientific inquiry. The discussion of ordinary-language paradoxes is intended to show how researchers and organizational actors discursively construct and make sense of conflicts, ambiguities, and contradictions to gain a better understanding of our surrounding world. Finally, the discussion of rhetorical paradoxes is intended to encourage reflexivity in theorizing within the RBV, with a view to opening up discourse.

### Logical Conundrums Within the RBV

Resource-based theory presents scholars with a dilemma, in that “the variables which are most theoretically interesting are those which are least identifiable and measurable” (Spender & Grant, 1996: 8). If a resource is unobservable, it cannot be easily imitated and, thus, forms the basis of sustained competitive advantage (Barney, 1991; Reed & DeFillippi, 1990). Yet if a resource is unobservable, it cannot be accurately measured and empirically verified (Godfrey & Hill, 1995); thus, ascertaining its ability to generate sustainable competitive advantage is rendered moot.

In addition to inimitability, Priem and Butler (2001) question the theoretical value of the RBV, especially Barney’s (1991) ideas that a resource must be valuable, rare, and nonsubstitutable in order to generate sustained competitive advantage. Drawing on Popper’s (1959) ideas on falsification, they argue that these RBV propositions are tautological—that is, they are true by definition and cannot be subjected to empirical testing.

Finally, some researchers have argued that the RBV is in danger of slipping into an “infinite regress” (Collis, 1994). By this they mean that RBV logic could lead to an endless and futile search for the ultimate stock of resources and capabilities that generate sustained competitive advantage. For example, once organizational learning is identified as a “core competence” (Lei et al., 1996; Prahalad & Hamel, 1990), it can trigger a never-ending process of “learning about learning how to learn” (Collis, 1994). Accordingly, this infinite regress problem could undermine the theoretical utility of the RBV in explaining and predicting sustainable competitive advantage.

These conundrums reflect the paradoxes of RBV epistemology, which some worry might limit the contribution of this theory (Foss, 1996; Priem & Butler, 2001).

Building on Lakatos’s (1978) ideas, we arrive at a different understanding of the role of these conundrums in advancing RBV scholarship. First, to the extent that falsification is used for assessing knowledge claims, sophisticated rather than naive falsification might be suitable insofar as it is used to appraise the RBV as a system of multiple and interdependent theories. As we discuss later, the RBV has undergone a proliferation of schools of thought, relying on different sets of theoretical assumptions and distinct analytical tools and vocabularies for investigating strategic management phenomena. Since such proliferation reflects healthy competition among the RBV schools, we regard it as a sign of theoretical progress.

Second, a hard core of the RBV research program appears to have emerged. Scholars working within the RBV have utilized apparently paradoxical constructs (such as causal ambiguity) and apparent tautologies within the RBV to expand the scope of this research program. Concepts such as tacitness, specificity, and path dependence (Dierickx & Cool, 1989; Reed & DeFillippi, 1990; Schoemaker, 1990; Teece et al., 1997) have become staples within the context of RBV theorizing. Efforts to further develop these core ideas for the purpose of increasing theoretical content might contribute to turning the RBV into a progressive research program. For example, researchers who have investigated the tensions between value creation and value capture (Bowman & Ambrosini, 2000; Moran & Ghoshal, 1999), and imitation and substitution (McEvily, Das, & McCabe, 2000), among others, have expanded the theoretical scope of the RBV research program. Efforts to accurately measure paradoxical constructs, such as causal ambiguity (e.g., King & Zeithaml, 2001), however, have produced equivocal results. These works might serve to confirm the paradoxical and tautological nature of these core RBV phenomena.

Third, Lakatos (1976) demonstrates how a theoretical system developed from basic self-evident truths or tautologies can advance by specifying new assumptions, auxiliary hypotheses, and/or contextual limits of applicability, or by introducing new terms or redefining old ones. Researchers working within the RBV research program have similarly capitalized on the tautological statements by identifying distinct assumptions associated with different schools of RBV thought (e.g., Conner, 1991; Schulze, 1994), by specifying temporal (e.g., Audia, Locke, & Smith, 2000; Leonard-Barton, 1992; Miller, 1993) and spatial (e.g., Miller & Shamsie, 1996) contexts within which different types of resources and capabilities contribute the most to firm performance, and by introducing new terms (e.g., Brandenburger & Nalebuff, 1995; Lado, Boyd, & Hanlon, 1997). Clearly, despite attempts to the contrary, naive falsification as a basis for refuting RBV’s core tenets has been roundly discredited (Mahoney, 1993; Powell, 2001). As we discuss in the remainder of the paper, the RBV research program appears to be thriving amidst an ocean of paradoxes and tautologies.

Fourth, the infinite regress conundrum within the RBV might not be such a damning liability in advancing the theoretical system, as those who subscribe to positivist philosophy of science would have us believe (e.g., Collis, 1994; Priem & Butler, 2001). Infinite regress is a problem only to those who subscribe to a “reconstructed logic” of science as a quest for certainty. But, as Kaplan has argued, a “reconstructed logic which tacitly assumes the fixity of meaning is a consequence only of our own fixation on the state of science at a given moment” (1964: 69). In contrast, researchers who work with paradox might embrace a “logic in use” viewpoint (Kaplan, 1964), which recognizes the indeterminacy and open-endedness of strategic management constructs as theoretical virtues (e.g., Bobko, 1985). Such logic encourages researchers to investigate RBV phenomena as dialectical processes of sensemaking (Weick, 1995). In this view, theoretical concepts are introduced, modified, and changed over time as researchers and practitioners gain new knowledge and understanding concerning how firms generate superior performance.

The paradox of organizational learning provides an example of how the notion of “logic in use” encourages a more complicated understanding of the dynamics of knowledge development in achieving strategic advantage (Leonard-Barton, 1992). Conceptualized as “single-loop learning” (Argyris & Schon, 1978), organizational learning may be efficiency enhancing, enabling the exploitation of organizational competencies to achieve competitive advantage (e.g., Fiol & Lyles, 1985; Lei et al., 1996; March, 1991). Although single-loop learning may enhance organizational adaptation, it might threaten adaptability, becoming a “rigidity trap” (Levitt & March, 1988) and a source of competitive disadvantage when organizational environments change drastically (Leonard-Barton, 1992). In contrast, viewed as “double-loop learning” (Argyris & Schon, 1978), organizational learning may promote innovation, enabling the exploration of organizational competencies. Yet double-loop learning may enhance adaptability but threaten adaptation (Weick, 1979), promoting inefficiencies in the use of scarce organizational resources.

By conceptualizing organizational learning as a dynamic juxtaposition of single-loop and double-loop processes of competence exploitation and competence exploration, respectively (March, 1991), we gain greater understanding of how competitive advantage is achieved or lost. Such juxtaposition might, however, create internal conflicts or colliding “thought worlds” (Fiol, 1995), as organizational actors struggle to make sense of these tensions and enact new meanings, prompting the need to further reconceptualize learning as core capability. The upshot is that rather than seeking objective knowledge for purposes of explanation and prediction by insisting on fixed meanings of concepts, such as organizational learning, core competence, and competitive advantage, the infinite regress conundrum suggests the need for researchers to embrace an epistemology that seeks greater understanding (Goodman & Elgin, 1988; Kaplan, 1964).

### Ordinary-Language Paradoxes Within the RBV

In order to advance understanding, in this section we apply an alternative theory-building strategy that encompasses paradox to three types of ordinary-language paradoxes within the RBV—causal ambiguity, imitation/innovation, and “rules for riches.” These paradoxes illustrate “the potential to enliven [the RBV] if researchers search for and work with inconsistencies, contradictions, and tensions” in the theory (Poole & Van de Ven, 1989: 575).

#### Causal Ambiguity Paradox

Causal ambiguity represents a mixed blessing for RBV scholarship. On the one hand, the relative difficulty of deciphering causal relationships between firm resources and capabilities and outcomes is claimed as a significant barrier to imitation of a firm’s competitive advantage (Barney, 1991; Lippman & Rumelt, 1982; Peteraf, 1993; Reed & DeFillippi, 1990). Further, sustainability of competitive advantage is enhanced when the firm’s resources and capabilities are “opaque” such that nobody (including the focal firm’s managers or employees) can understand their value-enhancing attributes. On the other hand, the opacity of resources and the difficulty of deciphering cause-effect relationships can frustrate the leveraging of such competencies within the firm to gain strategic advantage (Szulanski, 1996). Further interfirm relationships involving the exchange of such competencies are rendered moot. Thus, causal ambiguity both enables and frustrates sustainability of strategic advantage.

Researchers have attempted to “resolve” the causal ambiguity paradox by clarifying assumptions about time or levels of analysis. For example, Mosakowski (1997) has identified four “types” of causal ambiguity, based on whether the causal structure of strategic decisions can be ascertained before or after the fact of implementation. Empirically, King and Zeithaml (2001) claim to have resolved the causal ambiguity paradox by identifying and separating two dimensions: (1) characteristic ambiguity—the extent to which managers understand the specific resource attributes for superior firm performance, and (2) linkage ambiguity—the extent to which managers understand the causal structure linking resources to superior firm performance. Their research shows that linkage ambiguity, rather than characteristic ambiguity, is positively associated with superior firm performance. In both the Mosakowski and King and Zeithaml studies, causal ambiguity is viewed as relative uncertainty—a situation characterized by lack of complete knowledge.

In contrast, Daft and Lengel have argued that ambiguity also arises in situations of equivocality, referring to a decision context in which “multiple and conflicting interpretations” exist (1986: 556). Equivocality reflects lack of clarity, rather than lack of information, per se. Decision making under a situation of equivocality is akin to the “garbage can” model (Cohen, March, & Olsen, 1972), where participants may not know what questions to ask and may come up with “solutions” even if “problems” are not immediately evident. Whereas situations of uncertainty can be resolved through obtaining more complete and objective information, situations of equivocality can be resolved only through the exchange of existing information and the enactment of shared interpretations and understandings (Daft & Weick, 1984; Weick, 1979). Thus, conceptualizing causal ambiguity as a situation characterized by lack of objective knowledge only provides a partial explanation.

Rather than seeking causal determinacy through precision in measurement, researchers and managers might explore ways of using ambiguity strategically (Burke, 1969; Eisenberg, 1985). For example, taking a process-based perspective, Eisenberg (1985) demonstrates how managers can use ambiguity discursively to promote unified diversity, facilitate organizational change, and amplify actors’ existing attributions of cause-effect relationships. Burke (1969) argues that managing in equivocal contexts entails the deployment of “resources of ambiguity,” referring to the use of linguistic tropes, such as metaphors, analogies, similes, and scripts that convey compact descriptions of social phenomena and that permit collective interpretations and understandings (Weick, 1989). Thus, ambiguity provides an interpretive context in which organizational members make sense of and arrive at collective understandings of complex and contradictory phenomena.

#### Paradox of Imitation/Innovation

A central premise of strategy researchers is that a firm’s innovations must be protected from imitation, since imitation threatens the sustainability of competitive advantage (Porter, 1980; Rumelt, 1984, 1987). In analyzing conditions under which a firm’s resources can generate sustained competitive advantage, resource-based scholars focus on such phenomena as unique historical conditions, path dependencies, social complexity, and causal ambiguity (Barney, 1991; Reed & DeFillippi, 1990), which serve as barriers to imitation (Mahoney & Pandian, 1992; Rumelt, 1984). To the extent that imitators are kept in check through these mechanisms, innovators can thrive from the commercialization of their innovations, and they have the incentives necessary to undertake new innovations that are beneficial to society.

Other scholars, however, view imitation as the “handmaiden” of innovation (Haunschild & Miner, 1997); in a capitalist system, the two tend to go together (Schumpeter, 1934). Imitation may validate an innovation (e.g., Rogers, 1995), enhance an innovator’s legitimacy in the marketplace (DiMaggio & Powell, 1983; Tolbert & Zucker, 1983), and enable wider adoption and use of innovations in society (Farrell & Saloner, 1985; Rogers, 1995). Conversely, barriers to imitation may give rise to competence substitution, in which competitors create and use alternate resources and capabilities to achieve strategic advantage, thus obviating the need to imitate (McEvily et al., 2000).

Therefore, a tension exists concerning whether imitation chips away the benefits accrued by firm ingenuity, or whether imitation enhances innovation by fostering complementary resources. Within the RBV, one view holds that inimitability is an essential element of sustainable competitive advantage, yet barriers to imitation may give rise to innovations that subsequently erode the competitive advantage attributable to a firm’s distinctive competency. Recognizing this paradox, Conner (1995) has identified conditions under which an innovator may want to encourage imitation through the development of “clones” of its product. Such a situation may exist when “an industry is characterized by a positive network externality, i.e., when consumers value a product more, the more other consumers use it” (Conner, 1995: 210). Alternatively, McEvily et al. (2000) discuss ways to avoid or delay competence substitution through sharing knowledge. They suggest that, under certain conditions, “explicit knowledge might be more valuable if it is made public, where it can influence the expectations and behavior of a firm’s competitors, customers, and suppliers” (2000: 306). Accordingly, when positive network externalities are present, competitors may want to avoid technological rivalry through the use of common product components, but utilize unique business models.

A view of imitation and innovation as complements can yield a broader understanding of value creation. Imitation can spur innovation and foster knowledge development and use. Over time, competitive interactions among imitators and innovators may generate more refined consumer preferences (Carpenter & Nakamoto, 1994), engender positive network externalities (Farrell & Saloner, 1985; Katz & Shapiro, 1994), and produce greater socioeconomic value for firms and their stakeholders (Moran & Ghoshal, 1999). Late movers may gain strategic advantage through the adoption and use of a pioneer’s technological innovations (Shankar, Carpenter, & Krishnamurthi, 1998). Correspondingly, first movers that incorporate new product refinements stemming from competitive imitation (Lieberman & Montgomery, 1998) and that continually renew and upgrade their core competencies (Eisenhardt & Martin, 2000) can enjoy durable competitive advantages from initial innovations.

Thus, the imitation/innovation paradox suggests that when a firm seeks to avoid imitation by erecting barriers, it might actually encourage innovation by competitors that may substitute for the original innovation, prompting the firm to develop a new innovation to regain its competitive advantage. Further, the processes of knowledge development and use through innovation and imitation are self-referential such that the growth of knowledge in the industry is facilitated or constrained by the growth of knowledge within the firm (Fischer, 2003; Penrose, 1959). For instance, Barnett and Hansen (1996) have documented the self-referential processes characterizing competitive imitation and innovation. Accordingly, competitive pressures drive the search for ways to improve performance, resulting in organizational learning that fosters greater knowledge development and use, thus leading to a stronger competitive position for the firm. In turn, this success triggers rival firms to duplicate the firm’s sources of success, “making them stronger competitors, and so again triggering learning in the first organization” (Barnett & Hansen, 1996: 139).

#### Rules for Riches Paradox

Critics of the RBV have argued that the theory offers little practical guidance on how managers should build and sustain strategic advantage (Priem & Butler, 2001). Even though RBV advocates disagree, pointing out a number of ways managers can use RBV insights to achieve competitive advantage or neutralize competitive disadvantage, they generally agree that causal ambiguity sets a constraint on the practical applicability of the RBV for generating sustained competitive advantage (Barney, 2001a). Thus, RBV researchers appear to be caught in a “Catch-22” (Heller, 1961), conceding, on the one hand, that there are no rules for riches, and arguing, on the other hand, that managers can use RBV insights to gain competitive advantage.

The rules for riches paradox underscores a tension between descriptive and prescriptive theorizing within the RBV. As organization scholars who live in two worlds—one that “demands and rewards adherence to rigorous standards of scholarship” and another that “demands and rewards speculations about how to improve [firm] performance” (March & Sutton, 1997: 698)—RBV researchers must maintain a precarious balance between conflicting and even contradictory demands of the research community and of the community of practice, respectively. Researchers who emphasize prescriptive theorizing assume the role of legislators; they authorize themselves to propose rules for riches, which are presumed to guide and improve managerial practice.

In contrast, a business executive on a mission to gain and sustain strategic advantage is unlikely to look for clues in academic journals (or even popular business books authored by academics); he or she would understand that if there were rules for riches, others could equally use them to gain strategic advantage, and, in the long run, nobody would be better off (Barney, 2001a). Instead, the executive is more likely to seek out exceptions to the rules for riches (or enact his or her own rules) that potentially yield greater strategic advantage, rather than merely follow or adopt existing rules for riches (Brandenburger & Nalebuff, 1995). In this context, Farson (1996) suggests that once a person finds a managerial technique that works, he or she should abandon it.

Given the paradoxical nature of knowledge and truth as discussed previously, the scholar may fare no better than the practitioner in generating rules for riches. Astley and Zammuto (1992) suggest that rather than “engineers,” equipped with techniques for improving firm competitiveness, organizational researchers are more like “witch doctors.” Citing Andreski (1972), they note that the organizational researcher,

> possessing only very approximate and tentative knowledge, mostly of the rule-of-thumb kind, and yet able to exert much influence through his utterances ... resembles a witch doctor who speaks with a view to the effects his words may have rather than to their factual correctness; and then invents fables to support what he has said, and to justify his position in society (Astley & Zammuto, 1992: 456-457).

Rather than resigning themselves to the witch doctor role, however, RBV theorists could work cooperatively with practitioners and jointly enact new understandings concerning how strategic advantage is gained or lost. When a strategy theorist and practitioner show a genuine willingness to learn, they can gain greater understanding (Argyris & Schon, 1978). In contrast, when such exchange is characterized by “defensive routines” such that the assumptions concerning the basis for competitive advantage remain undiscussable, knowledge and understanding might be stifled (Argyris, 1986). Researchers might benefit when they adopt the role of student rather than teacher (Hamel, 1991) in their conversations with management practitioners on strategic issues. Arguably, understanding is enhanced when scholars and managers adopt a “polyphonic” approach to conversation, in which “several consciousnesses meet as equals and engage in a dialogue that is in principle unfinalizable” (Barry & Elmes, 1997: 444; see also Bakhtin, 1984).

For example, Rouse and Daellenbach (1999) note how understanding of RBV phenomena might be enhanced when researchers and organizational actors engage in dialogue. They illustrate how a linen supply company in the United Kingdom almost “outsourced” what turned out to be the company’s most important source of strategic advantage—the relationship between the firm (through its drivers) and its customers. This understanding emerged serendipitously through a conversation between a consultant hired by the firm’s top management and a truck driver, presumed to lack knowledge of factors that influence competitive advantage. The inclusion of all parties to the conversation yielded greater understanding of this firm’s competitive issues.

### Rhetorical Paradoxes in the RBV

From a rhetorical perspective, good science is good conversation (Mahoney, 1993; McCloskey, 1985), which begins with self-persuasion and ends with the persuasion of others (Gross, 1990). Self-persuasion involves, among other things, questioning underlying values and presumptions that drive our theorizing, with a view to opening up discourse. In the following subsections we discuss (1) conflicts among RBV schools of thought and (2) the performance paradox to illustrate how scholars might foster such conversation and promote reflexivity in theorizing. Although this discussion is brief, we hope it can serve as a basis for further research.

#### Conflicts Among RBV Schools of Thought

Over the years, different schools of thought within the RBV have emerged, each having distinct theoretical assumptions and propositions. For example, Schulze (1994) distinguishes between two perspectives within the RBV. In one perspective scholars assume a state of equilibrium and focus on how firms gain and sustain competitive advantage using their unique, valuable, and hard-to-copy resources (Barney, 1991; Wernerfelt, 1984). Proponents of the other perspective assume a dynamic process and focus on how asset stocks are accumulated, mobilized, and developed over time to generate a sustainable competitive advantage (Dierickx & Cool, 1989; Teece et al., 1997). Conner (1991) discusses the RBV within five schools in industrial organization economics, while Barney (2001b) positions the RBV within neoclassical, industrial organization, and evolutionary economic theories.

Although some of the propositions from these theories may be contradictory and even paradoxical when viewed together, researchers tend to avoid conflict or confrontation regarding these differences. On the one hand, the diversity of these perspectives reflects the strength and robustness of RBV logic. On the other hand, the tendency to avoid conflict might eventually produce “specialized versions of the [resource-based] theories which retard the recognition of relationships and generate diatribes between proponents of the ‘correct’ horn of the dilemma” (Poole & Van de Ven, 1989: 566). Furthermore, the avoidance of conflict implicit in this approach might not lead to the full realization of the benefits of theoretical diversity that result from the exchange of knowledge among the RBV schools.

Despite this theoretical diversity, the core logic of resource-based theory is rooted in an economic orthodoxy that tends to privilege the institutions of “market” and “hierarchy” as effective mechanisms of governance (Williamson, 1985). However, when the “invisible hand” of market (Smith, 1997) and the “visible hand” of hierarchy (Chandler, 1977) combine to marginalize and suppress voices of other organizational stakeholders (such as employees and special interest groups), as it sometimes does (as illustrated in recent corporate scandals and actions and their effects on the stock market, with disastrous consequences for stakeholders), resource-based research that is steeped in orthodox economics might risk becoming ideological and of little use in guiding managerial practice.

As Shrivastava (1986) notes, strategic management risks becoming ideological when it portrays sectional interests as universal, when it idealizes sectional goals (such as section), when it embraces the status quo (i.e., equilibrium) as the natural and desirable state, and when it denies contradictions and conflict. Pluralism in RBV scholarship is enhanced when scholars explore other conceptual terrains (e.g., heterodox economics; Caplan, 2000; Howard & King, 2001; Kern, 1997), use concepts and theories that properly represent the interests of other stakeholders (not just top management), and embrace contradiction and conflict as necessary aspects of theorizing.

#### The Performance Paradox

A rhetorical perspective also encourages us to constantly question our assumptions about what we know about firm performance. Firm performance or competitive advantage is a “slippery” construct to operationalize and measure. Meyer and Gupta note that, over time, measures of performance tend to “run down or lose their capacity to discriminate good from poor performance, [and] trigger ongoing creation of new regressions different from and, therefore, weakly correlated with existing regressions” (1995: 309). Similarly, competitive advantage—the dependent variable in much of strategic management research—is elusive. As Powell aptly points out, “Competitive advantages, especially resource-based advantages, do not exist as sensible entities, and researchers will not find them sunken deep within organizations, Titanic-like, creating sustained superior performance” (2001: 885). In a final critique, “The emperor of organizational strategies is mostly absent” (2023: 12).

The paradoxical perspective also enables us to explore the tension between knowledge about organizational performance and the power structures that legitimate and “normalize” such knowledge. As Bradbury and Lichenstein note, “The power of those in control produces the knowledge about how to act, and gaining that knowledge about ‘acting normal’ reproduces the power structure” (2000: 554). In theorizing about the sources of superior firm performance, researchers using the RBV need to be cognizant of their role in the reproduction of these structures that promote and maintain sectional interests of select stakeholders (e.g., managers and shareholders). By viewing organizations as arenas for “organized dissonance” (Ashcraft, 2001: 1301), or as “social spaces torn by members in contradictory directions” by resource owners with competing interests and values (Bouchikhi, 1998:), RBV researchers can more carefully investigate the dialectical processes associated with value creation, destruction, and appropriation among the firm’s stakeholders (Moran & Ghoshal, 1999).

## Discussion

In this article we have sought to reorient the ongoing debate concerning the scientific status and utility of the RBV. We are concerned that, rather than energizing the field of strategic management, this debate might generate more heat than light and “close further the minds of the already converted without opening the minds of others” (March, 1996: 280). Taking the view that paradox is embedded in scientific epistemology, we have argued that researchers can work within and through the RBV paradoxes to advance understanding, rather than insist on theoretical purity via Popperian falsification. These RBV paradoxes might reflect scientific anomalies that should be tolerated, as long as this theoretical perspective continues to produce interesting insights. As noted by Lakatos, “Anomalies, inconsistencies, [and] ad hoc stratagems can be consistent with [scientific]” (1978: 149). Further, to the extent that the world we live in is “paradoxical and fundamentally uncertain” (Wolf, 1989: 205), the quest for certainty (implicit in the traditional view of) through the denial or resolution of paradox is illusory (Berman, 1984).

As our discussion of the RBV paradoxes illustrates, a paradoxical perspective can invigorate scholarship and advance understanding. Three interrelated themes have emerged from this discussion. First, building on Lakatos’s ideas, we have argued that, as a research program, the RBV can continue to grow in an ocean of anomalies, paradoxes, and tautologies. Second, our discussion of ordinary-language paradoxes illustrates how the meanings of RBV phenomena are contested, emergent, and complex (Barge & Oliver, 2003), reflecting the interplay of organizational actors’ and researchers’ language games (Astley & Zammuto, 1992; Wittgenstein). Third, our discussion of rhetorical paradoxes within the suggests the need for researchers to take responsibility for the texts they craft (Bradbury & Lichenstein, 2000) and encourages greater reflexivity in scholarship (Cunliffe, 2003; Weick, 1999). We elaborate on each of these ideas for furthering RBV scholarship in turn.

In order for the RBV to move forward, researchers must dislodge Popperian (naive) falsification as the basis of empirical validation. To the extent that falsification is used, we emphasize编制 and the sophisticated rather than naive should be used. In line with Lakatos’s MSRP, researchers should direct any falsification efforts toward the “protective belt” of the RBV research program. This component of the theories appears to have generated a rich set of empirically testable propositions or hypotheses developed from multiple theoretical perspectives, as indicated by the RBV’s expanding purview. Accordingly, research that fosters pluralism in RBV scholarship (Spender, 1998) can contribute to expanding and enriching the protective belt of this program. Examples of such research include work that (1) reconceptualizes key theoretical constructs (such as firm performance or competitive advantage) to include multiple contradictory attributes (Meyer & Gupta, 1995), (2) uses multiple theoretical perspectives to address a particular research question (e.g., Allison, 1971), and (3) integrates positivist and interpretive research methodologies in a single study (e.g., Lee, 1991). If we direct our ingenuity to the service of discovery, rather than just empirical validation, a wide variety of research methods can be employed productively (Feyerabend, 1988; Leong, 1985; McCall & Bobko, 1990).

However, the hard core of the RBV research program, which evolved from underspecified constructs and apparently contradictory theories (such as those relating to resource value, rareness, and causal ambiguity), must remain immune to falsification attempts. Instead, scholars might want to explore conceptual opportunities to inject theoretical content into the hard core, for example, through reconceptualizing core RBV terms, such as opportunity cost, rent, and economic profit (e.g., Lippmann & Rumelt, 2003a,b), as a way to advance this research program. With the advent of postmodern scholarship, which emphasizes issues of undecidability of material, incredulity toward metanarratives, and crisis of representation, among others (e.g., Calás & Smircich, 1999; Kilduff & Mehra, 1997), we can expect more reconceptions of our categories of thought in the future. This is not, however, a sign of hopelessness in scholarship. Rather, it is an invitation for us all to do more to advance understanding (Goodman & Elgin, 1988). When core RBV constructs are subjected to multiple (and conflicting) interpretations, we gain greater understanding.

Our discussion of ordinary-language paradoxes underscores the role of language in enabling (or constraining) thought and action (e.g., Astley & Zammuto, 1992; Fiol, 1989; Van Maanen, 1995). Accordingly, research methodologies, such as discourse analysis (Fairclough, 1995; Hardy, 1991), and poststructural approaches (Barge & Oliver, 2003), are particularly suited to investigating idiosyncratic concepts and events, fluid, ambiguous, and emergent RBV phenomena. Research that documents how actors make sense of these phenomena through the use of linguistic and discursive resources can advance understanding. For example, Fiol (2002) documents how managers of a high-tech firm capitalized on paradox by employing linguistic and rhetorical strategies to achieve organizational cultural transformation. The use of narrative, textual, and rhetorical analysis (e.g., Zald, 1996) can enhance our understanding of how scholars and organizational actors strategically leverage linguistic ambiguity to construct (or deconstruct) new meanings of RBV phenomena.

The discussion of rhetorical paradoxes suggests the need for researchers to use conflict as an integral component of RBV scholarship. The view of the firm as an arena of multiple, dialectically opposing interest groups, values, or goals is well documented (e.g., Bouchikhi, 1998; Cyert & March, 1963; Sjoberg, 1967), yet researchers working within the RBV program continue to emphasize the theoretical view of the firm as a cooperative system (Barnard, 1938). This view might blind researchers to the seemingly contradictory demands or expectations society places on business firms. As documented by Margolis and Walsh (2003), businesses are increasingly called on to simultaneously pursue social goals intended to reduce human misery and economic goals designed to build shareholders’ wealth. Firms that pursue both sets of goals without compromising either have been shown to generate substantial returns (both economic and social) for their stakeholders. This work illustrates scholarship that exposes ideological underpinnings (Shrivastava, 1986) and sensitizes scholars to address broader societal concerns that contribute to the betterment of humankind (Griesinger, 1990; Whitehead, 1978).

Finally, we believe the RBV paradoxes are illustrative of a growing trend in organization and management scholarship, as exemplified by the work of Poole and Van de Ven (1989) and Lewis and colleagues (Lewis, 2000; Lewis & Grimes, 1999; Sundaramurthy & Lewis, 2003). These scholars have documented how paradoxes serve as conceptual “tools” that enable us to gain greater understanding of our surrounding world. Additionally, the paradoxical perspective we have adopted offers an epistemological framework that is better “adapted to messy, ill-behaved, complex art and science of strategy research and practice” (Powell, 2001: 878). We hope this discussion serves to free scholars from the paralyzing grip of naive falsificationism and to energize strategic management scholarship in years to come.
