## Abstract

In Industry 4.0 environment, supply chains have become prone to various risks due to rapid globalization and process digitalization. The uncertainties and unplanned and unnatural events that are internal to supply chain networks and external to the environment of a firm pertaining to global supply chains are regarded as supply chain risks. The objective of this study is to identify and analyze the various emerging supply chain risks for strategy formulation in Industry 4.0 environment. Based on a systematic literature review and experts' opinion, different supply chain risks in the present business environment have been analyzed. Major identified risks are operational and manufacturing process risk, behavioural risk, demand risk, governmental and organisational risk, system risk, financial risk, product recovery risk, social and environmental risk, supply risk, disruption risk, cyber security, and safety risk. For developing risk mitigation strategies, risk prioritization is very important. Sufficient research has not been done on ranking and categorization of these risks in the Industry 4.0 environment. Therefore, this study has tried to rank these emerging supply chain risks by the Technique for Order Preferences by Similarity to an Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) approach. These risks are further categorized as cause and effect using a Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL). This classification of risks will facilitate top management of the organization in formulating strategies for risk mitigations in the Industry 4.0 environment. The findings of the study imply that supply chain managers should focus on disruption risk; cyber security and safety risk in the current Industry 4.0 environment. As supply chain risk management is an emerging research area in Industry 4.0 environment, the findings of this study will be very useful for industry professionals and researchers for further studies.

## 1. Introduction

In the present business environment, the digitalization of processes has become a priority for supply chain professionals. The digital transformation of the supply chain is getting observed through the emergence of the fourth industrial revolution named Industry 4.0, which is a high-tech strategy. According to Ivanov et al. (2021), Industry 4.0 is defined as 'an integrity of technologies, organizational concepts and management principles underlying a cost-efficient, responsive, resilient and sustainable network, data-driven and dynamically and structurally adaptable to changes in the demand and supply environment through rapid rearrangement and reallocation of its components and capabilities'.

The application of Industry 4.0 in supply chains is called a digital supply chain namely Supply Chain 4.0, which is defined as 'a supply chain which involves the close collaboration of different stakeholders (e.g. suppliers and customers) and is built on digital technology, including but not limited to web-enabled technology, cloud computing, and Internet of Things'. Accordingly, various terms like smart supply chains, self-thinking supply chains have been used in literature for supply chains that cover digital platforms with suppliers, retailers, customers, and partners by integrating physical objects with cyber-physical systems.

The vision of Industry 4.0 is to digitally transform the traditional supply chains. It is being observed in the manufacturing organizations like Bosch, Volkswagen, DHL, GE, Adidas, Tesla to name a few. These organizations have been using different Industry 4.0 technologies like the internet of things (IoT), big data analytics (BDA), robotics, additive manufacturing (AM), and cloud computing (CC). According to PwC (2020), 98% of supply chain professionals mentioned efficiency as the main reason to invest in Industry 4.0.

The disruptive technologies of Industry 4.0 additionally bring various challenges and risks with them in the supply chains. The use of IoT has the challenge to integrate along multiple supply chains with heterogeneous technologies and data services; distrust and attack-related risks. IoT enables the collection of large quantities of information known as 'Big Data'. BDA has challenges related to transformational change; integrating volume, variety, and velocity. Cloud computing has a high risk of losing control over data and inadequate reliability of cloud providers. Further, the imperfect use of 3D printing/additive manufacturing can introduce several risks due to insufficient know-how. This exhibits that organizations face risks towards a digital transformation and knowledge sharing by investing in Industry 4.0 technologies.

The last couple of decades have been marked by various supply chain risks globally that had happened randomly and distinctively. For example, fire at Philips semiconductor plant in 2000; fire at Meridian Magnesium Products in 2018; earthquake, tsunami, and nuclear disaster in Japan in 2011; an earthquake in Japan in 2016; strikes at Hyundai plants in 2016. These external supply chain risks had severe disruptive impacts on organizations like Ford, GM, Toyota, etc.

Moreover, in past few years due to digital transformation, communication breakdown failure has been observed as a common risk factor in organizations like GE, Ford, and P&G. Further, organizations like Volkswagen, Hyundai, Maruti faced supply chain risk due to autonomous robots. Adidas failed in its Speed factory program, which used multiple technologies, due to a lack of attention towards its manufacturing process.

Moreover, recently the cyber and information risk is becoming more evident in supply chains. For example, a blast furnace at a German steel plant suffered significant damage from a cyber-attack in 2014. Organizations like FedEx, Hitachi, and Renault also faced cyber-attacks due to the WannaCry ransomware attack in 2017. Further, the recent COVID-19 outbreak was announced as a global pandemic on 11 March 2020 by World Health Organization. It has impacted supply chains globally.

These risks impact supply chain performance, directly and indirectly, that propagate through a supply chain causing the ripple effect. Moreover, in supply chain 4.0, the competition is not between supply chains, but between the information services and analytics algorithms behind them. Companies are reluctant to invest in these costly technologies as the technology standards are not yet known. Firms also have a fear due to the uncertainty of return on investment in Industry 4.0 technologies.

Supply chain risk management (SCRM) has become very crucial for managers in Industry 4.0 environment to prevent the greater vulnerabilities of value chains. Over the past few years, many studies have focussed more on traditional SCRM procedures. The intersections of Industry 4.0 and SCRM were first observed by Tupa, Simota, and Steiner (2017) and Schroder, Indorf, and Kersten (2014).

The digitalized supply chain processes and cyber-physical system (CPS) use the available data to improve supply chain robustness leading to smart SCRM. SCRM in Industry 4.0 context is described as 'the integration of technology (sensors, actors, connectivity, and analytics) along with supply chain processes to improve supply chain risk identification, analysis, assessment, mitigation and monitoring by processing real-time information sharing'. Therefore, the traditional SCRM framework comprising risk identification; risk assessment and risk mitigation will change in present business environment of Industry 4.0.

The literature on supply chain risk in context to Industry 4.0 is very limited. Therefore, there is a need to systematically assess and analyze the major supply chain risks emerging in the Industry 4.0 environment. Researchers and practitioners are facing challenges to further explore the causes and effects of different supply chain risks rising in the Industry 4.0 environment.

This study tries to close the above-mentioned research gaps in the existing literature by addressing the following research questions:

**RQ 1:** What are major supply chain risks in the Industry 4.0 environment?

**RQ 2:** How should managers prioritize these supply chain risks in order of severity while formulating strategies?

**RQ 3:** How should managers categorize these supply chain risks into causes and effects from a strategic perspective?

## 2. Research methodology

The present study is exploratory in nature which gives new knowledge and insights for managing supply chain risks in the digital age. A supply chain risk management process consists of three steps namely risk identification, risk assessment, and risk mitigation. To address the first two steps involved in the risk management process, a multiphase research design is adapted as shown in Figure 1.

### Figure 1. Multiphase research design framework

![Multiphase Research Design Framework](image-placeholder)

The multiphase research design involves the synthesis of quantitative and qualitative studies in sequential or concurrent form with multiple phases of data collection and analysis. This study adopts an exploratory approach followed by an explanatory sequential mixed method approach to guide the overall risk management process.

In the proposed research design framework, phase one is to identify and classify major supply chain risks in Industry 4.0 environment through systematic literature review (SLR) and experts' opinion. Next, this study uses an explanatory sequential mixed method approach for phase two, phase three, and phase four for supply chain risk assessment. Risks are ranked using the TOPSIS approach in phase 2 and categorized into cause and effects using the DEMATEL approach in phase 3.

### 2.1. Research design: phase 1-risks identification and classification

The major supply chain risks in Industry 4.0 environment are identified using systematic literature review and experts' opinion.

#### 2.1.1. Systematic literature review

A systematic literature review (SLR) methodology is used here for risks identification. The SLR approach identifies and assesses the literature for a specific research topic to the highest extent possible. It provides a high-quality review by minimizing bias and errors and helps in new knowledge creation due to its transparent and exhaustive process of analysis.

The SLR includes five steps as shown in Figure 2. The database used to screen the existing literature reviews are Scopus, EBSCO, Science Direct, Emerald, Sage, Informs, and Google Scholar. The keywords 'Industry 4.0' OR 'Digitalization' OR 'Supply Chain 4.0' AND 'Supply Chain risk' OR 'Supply Chain Risk Management' using AND, OR operators are used to search the research articles. Since Industry 4.0 term emerged in 2011, therefore the literature is searched from 2011 to June 2021.

### Figure 2. Systematic literature review process

#### 2.1.2. Experts' opinion

After identification of risks from SLR, the selected group of experts were contacted to suggest the additional risk sources apart from the identified risks through SLR with the help of a structured questionnaire. The experts were chosen mainly from manufacturing organizations located in India, as the unit of analysis for this study is the focal firm. Middle to senior-level professionals having experience of more than five years in the field of Industry 4.0 was contacted through social media websites like LinkedIn and Research Gate and personal contacts as well. After multiple follow-ups, 15 experts agreed to participate in the survey.

### 2.2. Research design: phase 2-the TOPSIS approach

TOPSIS has been the most widely used method among the 'MCDM' methods. To determine the best alternative solution, Yoon and Hwang (1981) proposed this method based on the concepts of compromise solution. A reliable solution is obtained as it nullifies the poor performance in one criterion by the good performance in other criteria. The solution has the shortest geometric distance from the positive ideal solution and the longest geometric distance from a negative ideal solution.

Major steps involved in the TOPSIS approach are described as follows:

**Step 1:** A matrix x_ij is made based on 'm' alternatives and 'n' criteria. Each element of this matrix represents the ith decision maker (DM) rating with that of the jth criterion.

**Step 2:** The normalized matrix is determined with elements as:
r_ij = x_ij / v(Sx_ij²)

**Step 3:** The weighted normalized matrix with values v_ij = w_j × r_ij is calculated.

**Step 4:** The negative ideal solution v_j? and the positive ideal solution v_j? are determined by finding the maximum and minimum elements of weighted normalized values in each column.

**Step 5:** The Euclidean distance is calculated to the positive and negative ideal solution.

**Step 6:** The relative closeness to the ideal solution c_i* is calculated. The best solution is depicted if it is closest to 1.

**Step 7:** All the alternatives according to the preference order of closeness ratio c_i* are ranked.

### 2.3. Research design: phase 3-the DEMATEL approach

DEMATEL is an exhaustive approach in which the structural model is built on the causal relationship of the criteria. DEMATEL has been considered as one of the most preferred tools among all MCDM methods for solving the cause and effect relationship among the evaluation criteria.

Different steps of the DEMATEL approach are as follows:

**Step 1:** Determine the decision group and judgement criteria

**Step 2:** Calculate the initial relation matrix and average matrix (A)

**Step 3:** Calculate the normalized initial direct-relation matrix (D)

**Step 4:** Evaluate the total relation matrix (T)

**Step 5:** Set the Threshold value, a

### 2.4. Research design: phase 4-qualitative interviews

Qualitative interviews help to explain the results from the MCDM approach. The four companies were selected based on the purposive sampling technique for an interview. The five industry experts were selected through both personal and professional networks. The interviews were conducted from 13 February 2020 to 31 May 2020 and each interview lasted between 45 min and 1 h.

##### 3.1.1.2. Classification of supply chain risks into different categories

According to Ho et al. (2015), supply chain risks are defined as the 'likelihood and impact of unexpected macro and/or micro-level events or conditions that adversely influence any part of a supply chain leading to operational, tactical, or strategical level failures or irregularities'.

The risks sources identified through literature review analysis were categorized into eight risk categories namely disruption risk, supply risk, operational and manufacturing process risk, governmental and organizational risk, demand risk, social and environmental risk, financial risk, and system risk. These risks are summarized in Table 4.

### Table 4. Describing supply chain risk categories in the Industry 4.0 environment

| Risk categories | Description | Sources of risk | References/sources |
|-----------------|-------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Disruption risk** | Unplanned and unanticipated events resulting in the interruption of supply and the movement of goods and materials within the supply chain | Fire accidents, natural catastrophes, economic downturn, legal disputes, and strikes | Ivanov, Dolgui, and Sokolov 2019 |
| **Supply risk** | Probability of occurrence of an event impacting organizational capacity in inbound supply to satisfy customer either due to individual or market supply side | Loss of suppliers (barriers to technologies), Different safety standards along with the SC, Loss of bargaining power over suppliers; Supplier bankruptcy, price fluctuations | Schroder, Indorf, and Kersten 2014; Ivanov, Dolgui, and Sokolov 2019; Gottlieb, Ivanov, and Das 2019 |
| **System risk** | Risk causing a long-term failure due to sudden fluctuations of activity in the supply chain. Risk in the supply chain due to delay of the technological information flow between the partners by insufficient connectivity | Technical Integration, Dependency, Standards, Compatibility, Complexity, Lack of robustness | Birkel et al. 2019 |
| **Operational and manufacturing process risk** | Probable deviances from making the desired quality and quantity at the right time. Risks related to Industry 4.0 which have humans, machines, and services as connected ecosystems by automating decisions in real-time | No Regular checking of communication networks, Higher vulnerability to operational accidents, Dependence on technology providers, Sabotage by employees, IT-interface problems, No established standards, Increased dependence on processes | Colak, Kaya, and Erdogan 2019; Tupa, Simota, and Steiner 2017; Schroder, Indorf, and Kersten 2014 |

#### 3.1.2. Experts' opinion

The risks identified from SLR were further shared with the experts for their feedback. Subsequently, experts suggested some new additional risk sources for the identified eight risks categories. In addition, experts suggested some new risk sources namely lack of trust towards supplier; deterioration of relationships among members of the supply chain. These risk sources were grouped under the behavioural risk category. The experts also suggested new risk categories namely product recovery risk, cyber security, and safety risks.

From the systematic literature review and experts' input, a total of eleven supply chain risks categories were identified in context to Industry 4.0 environment. These are operational and manufacturing process risk; behavioural risk; demand risk; governmental and organizational risk; system risk; financial risk; product recovery risk; social and environmental risk; supply risk; disruption risk; cyber security and safety risk.

### 3.2. Phase 2: ranking of risks using TOPSIS approach

The supply chain risks should be ranked for risk assessment as per the SCRM process. First, a team of three experts/decision-makers (DMs) was taken in this study for taking the input data. Three experts were chosen from the list of experts. The three DMs (DM1, DM2, and DM3) had the experience of more than 20 years in the supply chain domain. DM1, DM2, and DM3 were assigned a weight of '0.2', '0.4', and '0.4', respectively based on their experience.

### Table 5. Weighted normalized decision matrix

| Risk categories | DM1 (0.2) | DM2 (0.4) | DM3 (0.4) |
|-----------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| R1 | 0.083863 | 0.163299 | 0.185695 |
| R2 | 0.062897 | 0.09798 | 0.148556 |
| R3 | 0.062897 | 0.09798 | 0.111417 |
| R4 | 0.020966 | 0.130639 | 0.074278 |
| R5 | 0.020966 | 0.09798 | 0.074278 |
| R6 | 0.041931 | 0.09798 | 0.074278 |
| R7 | 0.062897 | 0.09798 | 0.074278 |
| R8 | 0.041931 | 0.130639 | 0.111417 |
| R9 | 0.062897 | 0.130639 | 0.148556 |
| R10 | 0.104828 | 0.130639 | 0.148556 |
| R11 | 0.041931 | 0.130639 | 0.111417 |

### Table 6. Relative closeness (c_i*) of each risk category to the ideal solution

| Risk categories | c_i* | Rank |
|-----------------|------|------|
| R1: Disruption risk | 0.872644 | 1 |
| R2: Operational and manufacturing process risk | 0.497809 | 4 |
| R3: Demand risk | 0.342702 | 7 |
| R4: Supply risk | 0.185688 | 9 |
| R5: Product recovery risk | 0 | 11 |
| R6: Behavioural risk | 0.127357 | 10 |
| R7: Governmental and organizational risk | 0.235939 | 8 |
| R8: Social and environmental risk | 0.343501 | 5 |
| R9: System risk | 0.584828 | 3 |
| R10: Cyber security and safety risk | 0.702335 | 2 |
| R11: Financial risk | 0.343501 | 6 |

It is observed that disruption risk is the top-ranking supply chain risk factor in the Industry 4.0 environment. Disruption risks are unpredictable and not under the control of the organization. They have a low probability with a significant long-term impact on overall organizations' performance that may propagate through a supply chain causing a ripple effect.

### 3.3. Phase 3: cause and effect analysis using DEMATEL approach

The risks were further assessed for cause and effect analysis as per the SCRM process. 15 experts were approached personally, out of which eight experts agreed to participate in decision making and the risks were assessed through a three-point scale (0–3 scale) in the matrix format.

Cause group factors are crucial as they have a direct effect on the overall structure of the system. Among all the cause risk factors, behavioural risk has the highest (r – c) value with 1.336 and impacts all other risk factors. The second highest cause risk factor is the operational and manufacturing process risk, having (r – c) value of 0.903.

The effect group factors do not impact the system directly but make a notable contribution to the system. Among all the effective risk factors, cyber security and safety risk receives the maximum impact as implied from its (r – c) value of -1.936.

### 3.4. Phase 4: validation of results of TOPSIS and DEMATEL

To test the robustness of the results of TOPSIS and DEMATEL, this study has adopted an interview-based qualitative approach. The interviews in the four companies presented detailed context-specific knowledge about the causes and effects and the ranking of supply chain risks.

### Table 10. Number of times risk categories coded across interviews

| Risk categories | Total number of times coded across interviews |||||
|-----------------|-------------|------|---------|-------|-------|
|                 | Alpha | Beta | Gamma | Delta | Total | Percentage of total | Rank |
| Social environmental risk | 14 | 8 | 17 | 12 | 51 | 11.89% | 4 |
| Cyber security and safety risk | 23 | 19 | 14 | 19 | 75 | 17.48% | 2 |
| System risk | 9 | 11 | 17 | 16 | 53 | 12.35% | 3 |
| Behavioural risk | 5 | 2 | 3 | 3 | 13 | 3.03% | 10 |
| Disruption risk | 17 | 14 | 21 | 33 | 85 | 19.81% | 1 |
| Financial risk | 8 | 6 | 5 | 9 | 28 | 6.53% | 6 |
| Governmental and organisational risk | 5 | 4 | 3 | 5 | 17 | 3.96% | 9 |
| Supply risk | 4 | 7 | 6 | 5 | 22 | 5.13% | 8 |
| Demand risk | 5 | 6 | 12 | 4 | 27 | 6.29% | 7 |
| Operational and manufacturing process risk | 13 | 12 | 13 | 11 | 49 | 11.42% | 5 |
| Product recovery risk | 3 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 9 | 2.10% | 11 |
| **Total** | **106** | **91** | **113** | **119** | **429** |

The analysis of qualitative interviews found that disruption risk, cyber security and safety risk, and system risk retained their top three positions. Further, from the qualitative interviews, the risk categories namely behavioural risk, financial risk, demand risk, and product recovery risk were found to have the order of their ranking almost similar to the TOPSIS approach. Therefore, qualitative interviews confirm the robustness of the results obtained through the TOPSIS approach.

## 4. Implications from the study

### 4.1. Theoretical implications

This study explores the supply chain risks which can occur in Industry 4.0 environment from theoretical and empirical aspects. This work is an initial effort that proposes a multiphase mixed-method approach to identify and assess the supply chain risks in Industry 4.0 environment specifically in context to a developing country like India.

Major contributions of this study are: 
(i) it generates and classifies relevant supply chain risks for Industry 4.0 based supply chains in an Indian context
(ii) This study prioritizes and provides the hierarchical causal relations of major supply chain risks occurring in the Industry 4.0 environment
(iii) This study extends the literature by proposing an integrated decision-making framework for SCRM in Industry 4.0 environment

### 4.2. Managerial implications

The result of the present study has some managerial implications for supply chain professionals and policymakers. Presently, most of the risks identified are not being addressed properly by supply chain managers due to high-cost factors and low visibility in the supply chains. The hierarchical causal relationships discussed in this study would enable supply chain managers to better understand the Industry 4.0 based supply chain risks.

This study provides a benchmarking framework to assist managers and government agencies in formulating decisive policies for effectively managing the supply chain risks in Industry 4.0 environment. The decision-making framework suggests that firms should at first identify the supply chain risks occurring in their organization.

## 5. Conclusion and scope for future research

In the present Industry 4.0 scenario, specifically during COVID 19 pandemic, organizations are extensively digitalizing their operations across the value chain. Therefore, it is important for researchers and practitioners to have a deep understanding and knowledge of the supply chain risk management process in the digital age.

This study first identifies major supply chain risk categories in Industry 4.0 based supply chains through systematic literature review and experts' opinion. The identified risk categories are operational and manufacturing process risk, behavioural risk, demand risk, governmental and organizational risk, system risk, financial risk, product recovery risk, social and environmental risk, supply risk, disruption risk, and cyber security and safety risk.

In this study, an explanatory sequential mixed method approach has been used for risk assessment wherein, the supply chain risks are ranked using the TOPSIS approach and further categorized as cause and effect groups using the DEMATEL approach. It is found using the TOPSIS approach that, disruption risk is the most important risk category occurring in Industry 4.0 environment.

The results of the DEMATEL approach indicate that behavioural risk is the most important driver of the risk category that can impact the organization's supply chain. It was also found that cyber security and safety risk is one of the major risks, which indirectly occur in Industry 4.0 based supply chains.
