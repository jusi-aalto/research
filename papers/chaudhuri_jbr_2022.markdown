Some small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are involved in recycling plastic waste to produce innovative products. These SMEs have adopted digital technologies, such as 3D printing and blockchain, to gain competitive advantage from their circular economy (CE)-based business models. However, the specific capabilities needed to create value for customers and to generate a competitive advantage for such SMEs are not known. In this study, we conducted in-depth interviews with four SMEs engaged in the CE to identify the specific resources and capabilities required. Using the resource-based view (RBV) and ambidexterity perspectives, we analyze how these SMEs leverage digital technologies and CE principles to provide value to customers. The results show that, combined with digital resources and explorative capabilities, CE resources and exploitative capabilities help SMEs to create value. Furthermore, we extend RBV by using organizational ambidexterity to explain how CE and digital technology adoption by SMEs can provide value to customers.

## 1. Introduction

In this research, therefore, we explore the capabilities needed by SMEs to implement 3D printing and blockchain to generate competitive advantage from their CE-based business models. The specific research questions we consider are as follows:  
a) Which capabilities are needed by SMEs implementing a circular economy to adopt digital technologies such as blockchain and 3D printing?  
b) How do the circular economy and digital technology-based resources and capabilities of SMEs provide value to their customers?

We conducted in-depth interviews with SMEs involved in recycling plastic waste and used qualitative analysis to develop testable propositions from those cases. The results show that, combined with digital resources and explorative capabilities, CE resources and exploitative capabilities help SMEs to create value. Furthermore, we extend RBV by using organizational ambidexterity to explain how CE and digital technology adoption by SMEs can provide value to customers.

## 2. Literature review

To develop an understanding of the relevant body of knowledge and theoretical support, we first review the literature associated with a CE-oriented business model innovation followed by technology as an enabler for the CE, and how the CE and digitalization can create value for customers. We then identify the gaps from the literature and conclude the section by providing theoretical support for our research.

### 2.1. Circular economy-oriented business model innovation

Business model innovation consists of creating, diversifying, acquiring, or transforming a business model as a response to internal and external contingencies. CE-oriented business models focus on maximizing resource efficiency, reducing waste, and creating sustainable value through practices such as recycling, reusing, and remanufacturing.

### 2.2. Technology as an enabler for circular economy

Digital technologies like 3D printing and blockchain act as enablers for CE by enhancing traceability, improving production efficiency, and enabling innovative product designs. 3D printing allows for on-demand production, reducing material waste, while blockchain ensures transparency in supply chains, fostering trust in CE practices.

### 2.3. Value creation for customers through CE and digitalization

The integration of CE principles and digital technologies can create value for customers by offering sustainable products, personalized solutions, and transparent supply chains. However, the specific mechanisms through which SMEs deliver this value remain underexplored.

### 2.4. Research gaps

Prior studies, such as Dey et al. (2020) and Ranta et al. (2018), have identified resources and competencies needed for CE-driven businesses but have not explicitly analyzed the role of digital technologies like 3D printing and blockchain in enhancing customer value for SMEs. Similarly, Kristoffersen et al. (2020) developed a framework for digital-enabled circular strategies but did not focus on SMEs.

### 2.5. Theoretical support

Resource-based view (RBV) explains how resources help a company to gain and sustain a competitive advantage. When resources are accumulated by a firm in a specific way, they are harder to imitate or substitute and are more closely tied to competitive advantage (Barney, 1991).

Resources are firm-specific assets that are difficult to imitate (Teece et al., 1997). Such resources can be tangible, such as infrastructure, or intangible, such as "know-how". The RBV identifies the characteristics that resources must possess to generate a competitive advantage: value, rarity, non-imitability, non-substitutability, and non-transferability (Barney, 1991). Resources are valuable when they enable a firm to implement strategies to improve efficiency and effectiveness, and rare when they are not possessed by a large number of competing firms.

Capabilities are created when resources are integrated, often through the development, learning, and exchange of knowledge among staff (Prieto-Sandoval et al., 2019). Knowledge enables dynamic organizational learning, while relational capabilities can augment the resources of alliance partners (Teece, 2000).

Circular economy business models require the acquisition of waste as resources (Centobelli et al., 2020) and access to reusable and recyclable materials to design circular processes and products (Prieto-Sandoval et al., 2019). Design and creativity are critical for developing competitive circular products or services. Other CE capabilities include developing green products, understanding competitors’ strategies, attracting talent with environmental values, managing traceability, creating synergies with compatible organizations, performing and sharing logistics operations, and developing effective green marketing (Prieto-Sandoval et al., 2019).

The conceptual research framework is shown in Fig. 1.

## 3. Methodology

We use qualitative case studies to identify the resources and capabilities needed to generate a competitive advantage for SMEs with CE-based business models implementing digital technologies. We conducted in-depth interviews with four SMEs engaged in recycling plastic waste. Data were analyzed using thematic coding to develop testable propositions.

---

## 4. Findings

The findings reveal that SMEs require a combination of CE-specific resources (e.g., access to waste materials, recycling expertise) and digital resources (e.g., 3D printing infrastructure, blockchain platforms) to create value. Exploitative capabilities, such as efficient recycling processes, complement explorative capabilities, such as experimenting with new digital tools, enabling SMEs to balance sustainability and innovation.

---

## 5. Discussion

We demonstrate how ambidextrous capabilities allow SMEs with CE-based business models to create value for customers by adopting digital technologies. This aligns with Cao et al. (2009), who found that balancing exploitation and exploration benefits resource-constrained firms like SMEs in improving performance.

We outline the characteristics of resources and capabilities in terms of value, rarity, non-substitutability, and non-imitability, and how they help provide value to customers. While prior studies (Ranta et al., 2018; Dey et al., 2020) explored how CE generates economic value and improves sustainability for firms, there is limited research on how CE and digital technologies provide value for customers. Our study contributes to this gap by integrating RBV and ambidexterity perspectives.
