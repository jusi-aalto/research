**Abstract**

Information systems researchers have a long tradition of drawing on theories from disciplines such as economics, computer science, psychology, and general management and using them in their own research. Because of this, the information systems field has become a rich tapestry of theoretical and conceptual foundations. As new theories are brought into the field, particularly theories that have become dominant in other areas, there may be a benefit in pausing to assess their use and contribution in an IS context. The purpose of this paper is to explore and critically evaluate use of the resource-based view of the firm (RBV) by IS researchers.

The paper provides a brief review of resource-based theory and then suggests extensions to make the RBV more useful for empirical IS research. First, a typology of key IS resources is presented, and these are then described using six traditional resource attributes. Second, we emphasize the particular importance of looking at both resource complementarity and moderating factors when studying IS resource effects on firm performance. Finally, we discuss three considerations that IS researchers need to address when using the RBV empirically. Eight sets of propositions are advanced to help guide future research.

## Introduction

In 1992, Mahoney and Pandian outlined how the resource-based view of the firm (RBV) might be useful to the field of strategic management. One benefit of the theory, they noted, was that it encouraged a dialogue between scholars from a variety of perspectives, which they described as "good conversation." Since then, the strengths and weaknesses of the RBV have been vigorously debated in strategic management and other management disciplines (e.g., Barney 2001; Fahy and Smithee 1999; Foss 1998; Priem and Butler 2001a, 2001b).

Very little discussion on the resource-based view, however, has been conducted in the field of information systems. The RBV has been used in the IS field on a number of occasions (see the Appendix for a list of IS research studies using the RBV), yet there has been no effort to date to comprehensively evaluate its strengths and weaknesses. This paper outlines how the RBV can be useful to research in IS, and provides guidelines for how this research might be conducted. In short, the purpose of this paper is to initiate a discussion of the RBV within the conversation of information systems research.

The paper is organized as follows. First, we briefly introduce the resource-based view of the firm and describe how the theory has relevance for IS scholars. Second, we present a typology of IS resources and then describe, compare, and contrast them with one another using six key resource attributes. Third, we address the important issues of resource complementarity and the role played by moderating factors that influence the IS resource-firm performance relationship. We then turn to a discussion of three major sets of considerations that IS researchers need to address when using the RBV in empirical settings.

## The Resource-Based View of the Firm

### An Overview of the Resource-Based View

The resource-based view argues that firms possess resources, a subset of which enables them to achieve competitive advantage, and a further subset which leads to superior long-term performance (Barney 1991; Grant 1991; Penrose 1959; Wernerfelt 1984). Empirical studies of firm performance using the RBV have found differences not only between firms in the same industry (Hansen and Wernerfelt 1989), but also within the narrower confines of groups within industries (Cool and Schendel 1988). This suggests that the effects of individual, firm-specific resources on performance can be significant (Mahoney and Pandian 1992).

Resources that are valuable and rare and whose benefits can be appropriated by the owning (or controlling) firm provide it with a temporary competitive advantage. That advantage can be sustained over longer time periods to the extent that the firm is able to protect against resource imitation, transfer, or substitution. In general, empirical studies using the theory have strongly supported the resource-based view (e.g., McGrath et al. 1995; Miller and Shamsie 1996; Zaheer and Zaheer 1997).

One of the key challenges RBV theorists have faced is to define what is meant by a resource. Researchers and practitioners interested in the RBV have used a variety of different terms to talk about a firm's resources, including competencies (Prahalad and Hamel 1990), skills (Grant 1991), strategic assets (Amit and Schoemaker 1993), assets (Ross et al. 1996), and stocks (Capron and Hulland 1999). This proliferation of definitions and classifications has been problematic for research using the RBV, as it is often unclear what researchers mean by key terminology (Priem and Butler 2001a). In order to simplify the interpretation of the theory, it is useful to clarify the definitions of relevant terms. In this paper, we define resources as assets and capabilities that are available and useful in detecting and responding to market opportunities or threats (Sanchez et al. 1996; see also Christensen and Overdorf 2000). Together, assets and capabilities define the set of resources available to the firm.

Assets are defined as anything tangible or intangible the firm can use in its processes for creating, producing, and/or offering its products (goods or services) to a market, whereas capabilities are repeatable patterns of actions in the use of assets to create, produce, and/or offer products to a market (Sanchez et al. 1996). Assets can serve as inputs to a process, or as the outputs of a process (Srivastava et al. 1998; Teece et al. 1997). Assets can be either tangible (e.g., information systems hardware, network infrastructure) or intangible (e.g., software patents, strong vendor relationships) (Hall 1997; Itami and Roehl 1987; Srivastava et al. 1998). In contrast, capabilities transform inputs into outputs of greater worth (Amit and Schoemaker 1993; Capron and Hulland 1999; Christensen and Overdorf 2000; Sanchez et al. 1996; Schoemaker and Amit 1994). Capabilities can include skills, such as technical or managerial ability, or processes, such as systems development or integration.

### What Can the Resource-Based View Contribute to IS Research?

A critical issue addressed in this review is the usefulness of the resource-based view to IS research. The RBV is increasingly being used by IS researchers and therefore it is valuable to pause and reflect on the actual utility of the theory to the IS field. That the theory has become influential in other management fields such as strategy and marketing merely points to its potential use in IS research. Usefulness in one field does not dictate usefulness in all fields. Furthermore, the IS field already incorporates theories from many other areas. This review will explore what, if anything, the RBV can offer that the IS field does not already obtain from elsewhere.

This review will argue that the RBV is indeed useful to IS research. The theory provides a valuable way for IS researchers to think about how information systems relate to firm strategy and performance. In particular, the theory provides a cogent framework to evaluate the strategic value of information systems resources. It also provides guidance on how to differentiate among various types of information systems—including the important distinction between information technology and information systems—and how to study their separate influences on performance (Santhanam and Hartono 2003). Further, the theory provides a basis for comparison between IS and non-IS resources, and thus can facilitate cross-functional research.

Yet, as currently conceptualized, the theory is not ideally suited to studying information systems. Unlike some resources, such as brand equity or financial assets, IS resources rarely contribute a direct influence to sustained competitive advantage (SCA). Instead, they form part of a complex chain of assets and capabilities that may lead to sustained performance. In the pariance of Clemons and Row (1991), information systems resources are necessary, but not sufficient, for SCA. Information systems exert their influence on the firm through complementary relationships with other firm assets and capabilities. While the RBV recognizes the role of resource complementarity, it is not well developed in the theory. The refinement of this element is necessary to enhance the usefulness of the RBV to IS researchers.

We recognize three aspects of the RBV that provide rare and valuable benefits to IS researchers. First, by way of a defined set of resource attributes, the RBV facilitates the specification of information systems resources. This specification provides the groundwork for a set of mutually exclusive and exhaustive information systems assets and capabilities. This review suggests a framework for this IS resource set. Second, by using the same set of resource attributes mentioned above, IS resources can be compared with one another and, perhaps more importantly, can be compared with non-IS resources. Thus, the RBV promotes cross-functional research through comparisons with other firm resources. Third, the RBV sets out a clear link between resources and SCA through a well-defined dependent variable, providing a useful way to measure the strategic value of IS resources. In addition, we recognize one area in which the theory is deficient as conceived—the complementarity of resources—and suggest a way to extend the theory to reduce the effect of this deficiency. We also suggest key moderating variables that are relevant to studies of the IS resource-performance relationship and that we believe warrant greater attention from IS researchers.

## IS Resources and the Resource-Based View

This section starts by reviewing RBV research conducted to date within the IS field, with an eye to identifying the major IS resources used in these studies. These resources are then organized using a typology proposed by Day (1994). This is followed by a description of six key resource attributes that have been employed by RBV researchers in the past. Finally, we describe each of the major IS resources identified previously using these six attributes.

### Information Systems Resources

The resource-based view started to appear in IS research in the mid-1990s (see the Appendix for a list of RBV studies conducted to date in the IS field). Much of this work has attempted to identify and define either a single IS resource or sets of IS resources. For example, Ross et al. (1996) divided IS into three IT assets which together with IT processes would contribute to business value. These three IT assets were labeled human assets (e.g., technical skills, business understanding, problem-solving orientation), technology assets (e.g., physical IT assets, technical platforms, databases, architectures, standards) and relationship assets (e.g., partnerships with other divisions, client relationships, top management sponsorship, shared risk and responsibility). IT processes were defined as planning ability, cost effective operations and support, and fast delivery. This categorization was later modified by Bharadwaj (2000) to include IT infrastructure, human IT resources, and IT-enabled intangibles.

Other categorization schemes have also been developed. (The Appendix summarizes these studies. In Table 2, presented later in the paper, we offer an alternative way of categorizing these constructs.) Feeny and Willcocks (1998) identified nine core IS capabilities, which they organized into four overlapping areas. These areas were business and IT vision (integration between IT and other parts of the firm), design of IT architectures (IT development skills), delivery of IS services (implementation, dealing with vendors and customers), and a core set of capabilities which included IS leadership and informed buying. Each capability was ranked as to how much it relied on business, technical, or interpersonal skills. Bharadwaj et al. (1998) suggested and subsequently validated a measure of IT capability with the following six dimensions: IT/business partnerships, external IT linkages, business IT strategic thinking, IT business process integration, IT management, and IT infrastructure. Each dimension was found to be reliable and valid using psychometric testing on a sample of senior IS executives.

The link between IS resources and firm performance has been investigated by a number of researchers. For example, Mata et al. (1995) used resource-based arguments to suggest that five key IS drivers—customer switching costs, access to capital, proprietary technology, technical IT skills, and managerial IT skills—lead to sustained competitive advantage, although they found empirical support for only the last of these proposed relationships. Powell and Dent-Micallef (1997) divided information systems resources into three categories: human resources, business resources, and technology resources. In a study of the U.S. retail industry, they found that only human resources in concert with IT contributed to improved performance. Among the business resources, only IT training positively affected performance, while no technology resources linked positively to performance at all.

Using an approach similar to that employed by Kohli and Jaworski (1990) to develop the marketing orientation construct, Marchand et al. (2000) proposed an information orientation construct comprised of three elements: information technology practices (the management of technology), information management practices (the management of information collection, organization and use), and information behaviors and values (behaviors and values of people using the information). These factors were validated using data from a large-scale cross-sectional survey. The study also found that firms ranking highly on all three information orientation dimensions tended to have superior performance when compared to other firms.

Many of the studies mentioned above divided IS resources into two categories that can be broadly defined as IS assets (technology-based) and IS capabilities (systems-based). Research has suggested that IS assets (e.g., infrastructure) are the easiest resources for competitors to copy and, therefore, represent the most fragile source of sustainable competitive advantage for a firm (Leonard-Barton 1992; Teece et al. 1997). In contrast, there is growing evidence that competitive advantage often depends on the firm’s superior deployment of capabilities (Christensen and Overdorf 2000; Day 1994) as well as intangible assets (Hall 1997; Itami and Roehl 1987; Srivastava et al. 1998). From an RBV perspective, this advantage may result from development of capabilities over an extended period of time that become embedded in a company and are difficult to trade. Alternatively, the firm may possess a capability that is idiosyncratic to the firm (i.e., an IS expert with specialized knowledge who is loyal to the firm) or difficult to imitate due to path dependencies (Dierickx and Cool 1989) or embeddedness in a firm’s culture (Barney 1991). Capabilities are often critical drivers of firm performance (Eisenhardt and Martin 2000; Makadok 2001; Teece et al. 1997).

### A Typology of IS Resources

Day (1994) suggests one approach to thinking about IS resources. He argues that the capabilities (as previously noted, a subset of the firm’s resources) held by a firm can be sorted into three types of processes: inside-out, outside-in, and spanning. Inside-out capabilities are deployed from inside the firm in response to market requirements and opportunities, and tend to be internally focused (e.g., technology development, cost controls). In contrast, outside-in capabilities are externally oriented, placing an emphasis on anticipating market requirements, creating durable customer relationships, and understanding competitors (e.g., market responsiveness, managing external relationships). Finally, spanning capabilities, which involve both internal and external analysis, are needed to integrate the firm’s inside-out and outside-in capabilities (e.g., managing IS/business partnerships, IS management and planning). Such an approach is entirely consistent with Santhanam and Hartono’s (2003) recent call to develop theoretically-based multidimensional measures of IT capability.

Table 1 suggests how eight key IS resources described in previous research can be organized within this framework. While this earlier work has used a variety of different terms for IS resources, it can be mapped directly onto Day’s framework, as shown in Table 2. Each of the resources in this table is described more fully below.

### Outside-In Resources

**External relationship management.** This resource represents the firm’s ability to manage linkages between the IS function and stakeholders outside the firm. It can manifest itself as an ability to work with suppliers to develop appropriate systems and infrastructure requirements for the firm (Feeny and Willcocks 1998), to manage relationships with outsourcing partners (Benjamin and Levinson 1993; Feeny and Willcocks 1998), or to manage customer relationships by providing solutions, support, and/or customer service (Bharadwaj 2000; Bharadwaj et al. 1998). Many large IS departments rely on external partners for a significant portion of their work. The ability to work with and manage these relationships is an important organizational resource leading to competitive advantage and superior firm performance.

**Market responsiveness.** Market responsiveness involves both the collection of information from sources external to the firm as well as the dissemination of a firm’s market intelligence across departments, and the organization’s response to that learning (Day 1994; Kohli and Jaworski 1990). It includes the abilities to develop and manage projects rapidly (Ross et al. 1996) and to react quickly to changes in market conditions (Bharadwaj 2000; Feeny and Ives 1990; Zaheer and Zaheer 1997). A key aspect of market responsiveness is strategic flexibility, which allows the organization to undertake strategic change when necessary (Bharadwaj 2000; Jarvenpaa and Leidner 1998; Powell and Dent-Micallef 1997).

### Spanning Resources

**IS-business partnerships.** This capability represents the processes of integration and alignment between the IS function and other functional areas or departments of the firm. The importance of IS alignment, particularly with business strategy, has been well documented (e.g., Chan et al. 1997; Reich and Benbasat 1996). This resource has variously been referred to as synergy (Bharadwaj 2000; Jarvenpaa and Leidner 1999), assimilation (Armstrong and Sambamurthy 1999), and partnerships (Bharadwaj et al. 1998; Ross et al. 1996). All of these studies recognize the importance of building relationships internally within the firm between the IS function and other areas or departments. Such relationships help to span the traditional gaps that exist between functions and departments, resulting in superior competitive position and firm performance. An element of this resource is the support for collaboration within the firm.

**IS planning and change management.** The capability to plan, manage, and use appropriate technology architectures and standards also helps to span these gaps. Key aspects of this resource include the ability to anticipate future changes and growth, to choose platforms (including hardware, network, and software standards) that can accommodate this change (Feeny and Willcocks 1998; Ross et al. 1996), and to effectively manage the resulting technology change and growth (Bharadwaj et al. 1998; Mata et al. 1995). This resource has been defined variously in previous research as “understanding the business case” (Feeny and Willcocks 1998; Ross et al. 1996), “problem solving orientation” (Ross et al. 1996), and “capacity to manage IT change” (Benjamin and Levinson 1993). It includes the ability of IS managers to understand how technologies can and should be used, as well as how to motivate and manage IS personnel through the change process (Bharadwaj 2000).

### Inside-Out Resources

**IS infrastructure.** Most studies recognize that many components of IS infrastructure (such as off-the-shelf computer hardware and software) convey no particular strategic benefit due to lack of rarity, ease of imitation, and ready mobility. Thus, the types of IS infrastructure mentioned in most of the existing RBV-IS studies are either proprietary or complex and hard to imitate (Benjamin and Levinson 1993; Lopes and Galletta 1997). Despite these attempts to focus on the non-imitable aspects of IS infrastructure, the IS infrastructure resource has generally not been found to be a source of sustained competitive advantage for firms (Mata et al. 1995; Powell and Dent-Micallef 1997; Ray et al. 2001).

**IS technical skills.** IS technical skills are a result of the appropriate, updated technology skills, relating to both systems hardware and software, that are held by the IS/IT employees of a firm (Bharadwaj 2000; Ross et al. 1996). Such skills do not include only current technical knowledge, but also the ability to deploy, use, and manage that knowledge. Thus, this resource is focused on technical skills that are advanced, complex, and, therefore, difficult to imitate. Although the relative mobility of IS/IT personnel tends to be high, some IS skills cannot be easily transferred, such as corporate-level knowledge assets (Bharadwaj 2000) and technology integration skills (Feeny and Willcocks 1998), and, thus, these resources can become a source of sustained competitive advantage. This capability is focused primarily on the present.

**IS development.** IS development refers to the capability to develop or experiment with new technologies (Bharadwaj 2000; Jarvenpaa and Leidner 1998; Lopes and Galletta 1997), as well as a general level of alertness to emerging technologies and trends that allow a firm to quickly take advantage of new advances (Zaheer and Zaheer 1997). Thus, IS development is future-oriented. IS development includes capabilities associated with managing a systems development life-cycle that is capable of supporting competitive advantage (Bharadwaj 2000; Marchand et al. 2000; Ross et al. 1996), and should therefore lead to superior firm performance.

**Cost effective IS operations.** This resource encompasses the ability to provide efficient and cost-effective IS operations on an ongoing basis. Firms with greater efficiency can develop a long-term competitive advantage by using this capability to reduce costs and develop a cost leadership position in their industry (Barney 1991; Porter 1985). In the context of IS operations, the ability to avoid large, persistent cost overruns, unnecessary downtime, and system failure is likely to be an important precursor to superior performance (Ross et al. 1996). Furthermore, the ability to develop and manage IT systems of appropriate quality that function effectively can be expected to have a positive impact on performance (Bharadwaj 2000; Feeny and Willcocks 1998).

### Resource Attributes

In order to explore the usefulness of the RBV for IS research, it is necessary to explicitly recognize the characteristics and attributes of resources that lead them to become strategically important. Although firms possess many resources, only a few of these have the potential to lead the firm to a position of sustained competitive advantage. What is it, then, that separates regular resources from those that confer a sustainable strategic benefit? RBV theorists have approached this question by identifying sets of resource attributes that might conceptually influence a firm’s competitive position. Under this view, only resources exhibiting all of these attributes can lead to a sustained competitive advantage (SCA) for the firm. For example, Barney (1991) suggested that advantage-creating resources must possess four key attributes: value, rareness, inimitability, and non-substitutability. Other typologies have been proposed by Amit and Schoemaker (1993), Black and Boal (1994), Collis and Montgomery (1995), and Grant (1991). Although the terms employed across these frameworks are somewhat different, all attempt to link the heterogeneous, imperfectly mobile, and inimitable, firm-specific resource sets possessed by firms to their competitive positions. Before suggesting how the IS resources identified above can be described using these attributes, we first discuss these attributes more generally as they are viewed in the context of the RBV.

Some researchers have made the useful distinction between resources that help the firm attain a competitive advantage and those that help the firm to sustain that advantage (e.g., Piccoli et al. 2002; Priem and Butler 2001a). Borrowing from terminology used by Peteraf (1993), these two types of resource attributes can be thought of as, respectively, ex ante and ex post limits to competition. Most previous research using the RBV has blurred these two phases, but we believe that they need to be considered separately.

Ex ante limits to competition suggest that prior to any firm’s establishing a superior resource position, there must be limited competition for that position. If any firm wishing to do so can acquire and deploy resources to achieve the position, it cannot by definition be superior. Attributes in this category include value, rarity, and appropriability. Firm resources can only be a source of SCA when they are valuable. A resource has value in an RBV context when it enables a firm to implement strategies that improve efficiency and effectiveness (Barney 1991). Resources with little or no value have a limited possibility of conferring an SCA on the possessing firm. To take an extreme example, the use of a new, innovative paper clip design may set one firm apart from others, but it is unlikely the paper clip design would be valuable from a competitive advantage standpoint.

Resources that are valuable cannot become sources of competitive advantage if they are in plentiful supply. Rarity refers to the condition where the resource is not simultaneously available to a large number of firms (Amit and Schoemaker 1993). For example, an ATM network might have significant value to a bank, but since it is not rare, it is unlikely to confer a strategic benefit.

The appropriability of a resource relates to its rent earning potential (Amit and Schoemaker 1993; Collis and Montgomery 1995; Grant 1991). The advantage created by a rare and valuable resource or by a combination of resources may not be of major benefit if the firm is unable to appropriate the returns accruing from the advantage. Technical skills provide an example of this phenomenon. The additional benefit accruable to a firm from hiring employees with rare and valuable technical skills may be appropriated away by the employee through higher than normal wage demands. Similarly, a computer component supplier may be unable to enjoy the benefits of improved cost efficiencies if the computer manufacturer (i.e., the buyer) is sufficiently powerful to appropriate away such benefits. This might be done by sharing the learning with other suppliers, or by pitting more efficient suppliers against one another, forcing them to set lower prices than they might otherwise establish in order to win the business.

Ex post limits to competition mean that subsequent to a firm’s gaining a superior position and earning rents, there must be forces that limit competition for those rents (Hidding 2001; Peteraf 1993). Attributes in this category include imitability, substitutability, and mobility.

In order to sustain a competitive advantage, firms must be able to defend that advantage against imitation. The advantage accruing from newly developed features of computer hardware, for instance, are typically short-lived since competitors are able to quickly duplicate the technology (Mata et al. 1995). According to Barney (1991), there are three factors that can contribute to low imitability: unique firm history, causal ambiguity, and social complexity. The role of history recognizes the importance of a firm’s unique past, a past that other firms are no longer able to duplicate—the so-called Ricardian argument. For example, a firm might purchase a piece of land at one point in time that subsequently becomes very valuable (Hirshleifer 1980; Ricardo 1966). Causal ambiguity exists when the link between a resource and the competitive advantage it confers is poorly understood. This ambiguity may lie in uncertainty about how a resource leads to SCA, or it may lie in lack of clarity about which resource (or combination of resources) leads to SCA. Such ambiguity makes it extremely hard for competing firms to duplicate a resource or copy the way in which it is deployed (Alchian 1950; Barney 1986, 1991; Dierickx and Cool 1989; Lippman and Rumelt 1982; Reed and DeFillippi 1990). If a firm understands how and why its resources lead to SCA, then competing firms can take steps to acquire that knowledge, such as hiring away key personnel, or closely observing firm processes and outcomes. Finally, social complexity refers to the multifarious relationships within the firm and between the firm and key stakeholders such as shareholders, suppliers, and customers (Hambrick 1987; Klein and Leffler 1981). The complexity of these relationships makes them difficult to manage and even more difficult to imitate. An example of this is Wal-Mart’s logistics management system. Even if all the individual elements are in place, the relationships between the elements, and thus its complexity, would likely result in an imperfect substitute (Dierickx and Cool 1989).

A resource has low substitutability if there are few, if any, strategically equivalent resources that are, themselves, rare and inimitable (Amit and Schoemaker 1993; Black and Boal 1994; Collis and Montgomery 1995). Firms may find, for example, that excellence in IS product development, systems integration, or environmental scanning may be achieved through a number of equifinal paths.

Once a firm establishes a competitive advantage through the strategic use of resources, competitors will likely attempt to amass comparable resources in order to share in the advantage. A primary source of resources is factor (i.e., open) markets (Grant 1991). If firms are able to acquire the resources necessary to imitate a rival’s competitive advantage, the rival’s advantage will be short-lived. Thus, a requirement for sustained competitive advantage is that resources be imperfectly mobile or non-tradable (Amit and Schoemaker 1993; Barney 1991; Black and Boal 1994; Dierickx and Cool 1989). Some resources are more easily bought and sold than others. Technological assets, for example, such as computer hardware and software, are relatively easy to acquire. Technical knowledge, managerial experience, and many skills and abilities are less easy to obtain. Other resources, such as company culture, brand assets, and so on, may only be available if the firm itself is sold (Grant 1991).

The preceding attributes—both ex ante and ex post—are summarized in Table 3. Conceptually, the two types of resource attributes are related. When a resource is imitated, more of that resource exists than before, and thus it becomes less rare. Resources that are highly mobile may be acquired by competing firms, again affecting the rarity of the resource for that firm (but not its overall rarity in the marketplace). Substitutability, by contrast, affects resource value, not rarity. Resources do not become less rare by having multiple substitutes; however, their value can be expected to diminish as substitute resources are developed. This conceptualization is shown in Figure 1.

**Table 3. Resource Attributes**

| Resource Attribute | Terminology |
|-------------------|-------------|
| **Ex ante limits to competition** | |
| Value | Value (Barney 1991; Dierickx and Cool 1989) |
| Rarity | Rare (Barney 1991)<br>Scarcity (Amit and Schoemaker 1993)<br>Idiosyncratic assets (Williamson 1979) |
| Appropriability | Appropriability (Amit and Schoemaker 1993; Collis and Montgomery 1995; Grant 1991) |
| **Ex post limits to competition** | |
| Imitability | Imperfect imitability: history dependent, causal ambiguity, social complexity (Barney 1991)<br>Replicability (Grant 1991)<br>Inimitability (Amit and Schoemaker 1993; Andrews 1971; Collis and Montgomery 1995)<br>Uncertain imitability (Lippman and Rumelt 1982)<br>Social Complexity (Fiol 1991)<br>Causal ambiguity (Dierickx and Cool 1989) |
| Substitutability | Non-substitutability (Barney 1991)<br>Transparency (Grant 1991)<br>Substitutability (Collis and Montgomery 1995)<br>Limited substitutability (Amit and Schoemaker 1993; Dierickx and Cool 1989)<br>Substitutes (Black and Boal 1994) |
| Mobility | Imperfect mobility (Barney 1991)<br>Transferability (Grant 1991)<br>Low tradability (Amit and Schoemaker 1993; Dierickx and Cool 1989)<br>Tradability (Black and Boal 1994) |

### IS Resource Attributes

In this section, we use the resource attributes introduced above to describe the IS resources identified earlier in the paper. The relationships between these resources and their attributes are summarized in Table 4. The entries in this table should be interpreted in relative (i.e., versus other IS resources) terms.

**Table 4. IS Resources, by Attribute**

|  | Advantage Creation |  |  | Advantage Sustainability |  |  |
|---|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
|  | Value | Rarity | Appropriability | Imitability | Substitutability | Mobility |
| **Outside-In** |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| External relationship management | H | M-H | L-M | L | L-M | L |
| Market responsiveness | H | M-H | L-M | L | L-M | L |
| **Spanning** |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| IS-business partnerships | H | M-H | L-M | L | L-M | L |
| IS management/planning | H | M-H | L-M | L-M | L-M | M |
| **Inside-Out** |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| IS infrastructure | M-H | L-M | H | H | L-M | H |
| IS technical skills | M-H | L-M | M | M | M-H | M-H |
| IS development | M-H | M | M | M | M-H | M |

## Dynamic Resources

A growing body of literature seeks to more formally incorporate the competitive environment into resource-based thinking. One focus of this research has been on the distinction between stable and dynamic environments. Some resources are more useful to the firm in relatively stable environments while others are more useful in dynamic, unstable, or volatile environments (Miller and Shamsie 1996). The former have been dubbed core resources, while the latter have been called dynamic resources (Eisenhardt and Martin 2000; Teece et al. 1997).

The distinction between these two resource types represents an extension of the traditional static RBV conceptualization. The resource-based view has been criticized for ignoring factors surrounding resources, instead assuming that they simply exist (Stinchcombe 2000). Considerations such as how resources are developed, how they are integrated within the firm, and how they are released have been under-explored in the literature. The mechanisms underlying how exactly key resources benefit the firm are also poorly specified in the RBV. The concept of dynamic resources attempts to bridge these gaps by adopting a process approach: by acting as a buffer between core resources and the changing business environment, dynamic resources help a firm adjust its resource mix and thereby maintain the sustainability of the firm’s competitive advantage, which otherwise might be quickly eroded (Eisenhardt and Martin 2000; Teece et al. 1997; Volberda 1996).

Although IS researchers using the RBV have not typically looked at dynamic resources, a study by Jarvenpaa and Leidner (1998) suggests that IS resources may take on many of the attributes of dynamic resources, and thus may be particularly useful to firms operating in rapidly changing environments. Thus, even if IS resources do not directly lead the firm to a position of superior SCA, they may nonetheless be critical to the firm’s longer-term competitiveness in unstable environments if they help it to develop, add, integrate, and release other key resources over time. The dynamic resources perspective provides an avenue for renewed relevance of IS resources beyond their traditional interpretation within the context of the RBV. This suggests that IS studies of resources (both IS and non-IS) will be particularly informative when conducted in highly turbulent business environments.

## Summary and Conclusions

The resource-based view of the firm is a robust theory that has received wide acceptance in other management fields. While it has been used on a number of occasions in IS research, there has been no comprehensive effort to describe or defend its use in an IS context. The purpose of this paper has been to provide an overview of the RBV for those who wish to understand and use the theory in IS research.

The resource-based view of the firm is a useful tool for researchers to understand if, and how, particular parts of the firm affect the firm at large. Many parts have been extensively researched. For example, brands, patents, product development practices, knowledge management capabilities, and the like have been extensively researched in the management disciplines. Other parts are less well understood. As we have suggested here, the RBV provides a way for IS researchers to understand the role of information system within the firm. Once the role of IS resources has been explored and defined, it can be compared on equal terms with the roles played by other firm resources to eventually form an integrated understanding of long-term firm competitiveness.

The resource-based view makes a useful distinction between information technology and information systems. The former is asset-based, while the latter comprises a mixture of assets and capabilities formed around the productive use of information technology. It is our contention that the RBV, through its focus on attributes and its recognition of the importance of resource complementarity, will uncover an enhanced role for information systems in sustained firm competitiveness. And it is our hope that the discussions, issues, and ideas set forth in the paper will stimulate interest and research incorporating the RBV in the field of information systems.
