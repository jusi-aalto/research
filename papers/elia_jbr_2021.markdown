Building on the resource-based view (RBV) perspective of the firm and firms’ competitive capabilities, this study examines the digital export drivers as means for firms to exploit opportunities brought about by digital technologies in their B2C digital marketing activities. By leveraging a unique dataset covering 102 Italy-based firms of different sizes (small, medium, and large), active in three different sectors (design and furniture, fashion, and food and beverage), this work examines the role of firm resources to support internationalization via digital channels. We find that: (1) SMEs do not suffer from a weaker propensity to engage with digital export despite resource constraints; (2) firms leveraging digital technologies are more likely to enhance their digital export; (3) firms employing an e-commerce manager are more likely to enhance their digital export strategy than firms employing a traditional export manager.

The paper is organized as follows. In the next section a literature review is illustrated. The third section describes the data and methods. Section four portrays the major findings. The fifth section discusses the findings, elucidates the theoretical contribution of the findings, including the main theoretical implications, portrays the study’s limitations, and explores paths for future research. The sixth and last section puts forward the concluding remarks.

## 2. Literature review

### 2.1. The resource-based view of the firm and firms’ capabilities in the digital age

#### 2.1.1. Digital resources
Combining studies rooted in neo-classical economics (e.g., Ricardo, 1817), anti-trust theory (e.g., Demsetz, 1973), evolutionary economics (Nelson & Winter, 1982), and firm resource heterogeneity (Penrose, 1958; Rumelt, 1984; Wernerfelt, 1984), and positioning his work in structure-conduct-performance (SCP) work (Porter, 1980), Barney (1991) laid the foundations of the RBV theory of the firm at the beginning of the 1990s. The theory explains how firms’ value and profit are generated based on firms’ resources to be conceived as “all assets, capabilities, organizational processes, firm attributes, information, knowledge, etc. controlled by a firm that enable the firm to conceive of and implement strategies that improve its efficiency and effectiveness” (Barney, 1991, p. 101). More specifically, to be able to create value and profits, firms need to access resources that are (a) valuable in that they are able either to neutralize threats or exploit opportunities; (b) rare because a fraction of the current and prospective competitors can access them; (c) imperfectly imitable; and (d) non-substitutable.

Research on marketing has found that resources by themselves are not always sufficient to generate significant performance gains; rather, they have to be transformed into distinctive capabilities (e.g., Bharadwaj, 2000; Chang, Park, & Chaiy, 2010; Dagnino & Mariani, 2007; Melville, Kraemer, & Gurbaxani, 2004; Roberts & Grover, 2012; Trainor, Andzulis, Rapp, & Agnihotri, 2014). Taken together, the findings of the aforementioned literature suggest that investment in technological resources is not necessarily conducive to superior performance. Rather, they suggest that technological resources should be combined with other organizational resources that include a human component consisting of technical skills and an intangible component encompassing organizational culture.

Among the human component of firms’ capabilities (consisting of technical skills) there are also digital capabilities (Gurbaxani & Dunkle, 2019; Tolstoy et al., 2020), which are defined as the competences by which companies align the features of digital technology with customers’ needs and wants (Chaffey, Hemphill, & Edmundson-Bird, 2015) and which are becoming increasingly relevant for successful digital transformation.

### 2.2.2. Digital technologies as resources driving digital export
The emergence and consolidation of ICTs in the last decades has enabled firms to reduce transactions costs, e.g., those linked to transportation, communication, and coordination (Alcacer et al., 2016). These benefits have led companies to increasingly adopt ICTs in their internationalization processes (Chen & Kamal, 2016) across a number of different industries and stakeholders (Baourakis, Kourgiantakis, & Migdalas, 2002; Bennamoon, Singh, Lehoert, & Lee, 2019). Nonetheless, adopting technologies also brings an increased need for investments. Especially for complex types of ICTs, high sunk costs and additional costs of coordination among adopting firm units are often involved (Alcacer et al., 2016). Although the ultimate value of technology adoption is difficult to estimate ex-ante and may depend on several contextual factors, it is a fact that digital technologies are becoming increasingly widespread. Recent research has shown that many companies that engage with exporting activities also make use of digital technologies in support of critical areas for their internationalization strategy, such as new product development, marketing and communication, and cross-border logistics (Digital Export Observatory, 2020). The adoption of digital technologies represents one of the most significant international business developments of the past few years. Nonetheless, only a limited portion of academic studies investigates the role of digital innovation in companies’ internationalization processes (Ginizy, 2019; Watson, Weaven, Perkins, Sardana, & Palmatier, 2018). On the one hand, similar to ICTs, digital technologies (e.g., the Internet of Things, additive manufacturing, blockchain) have an important role in facilitating the management of both domestic and foreign operations. The coordination and integration of the value chain is more effective thanks to blockchain and the Internet of Things, while additive manufacturing allows higher productivity to be reached, thus leading to better performances and higher international competitiveness (Nambisan, 2017). On the other hand, beyond the productivity gains brought about by digital technologies, additional benefits arise from the synergies that specific technologies create for the sales and distribution phases when combined with e-commerce. Regarding the former, it is becoming crucial to extract value from the increasing amount and variety of data collected via multiple channels (Colombo & Ferrari, 2015; Lee, 2017). The diffusion of online sales channels is progressively shaping the retail industry, leading to omnichannel strategies. These aim to provide a seamless experience to customers shopping via all available channels, such as physical channels, catalogues, online, and mobile channels (Lee, 2017; Vakulenko et al., 2019). The diversification of channels and data sources makes data aggregation more challenging, therefore big data mining is needed to perform market analysis which can help firms predict customer purchase, suggest ideas for cross-selling, and design marketing strategies. This is especially relevant in an internationalization context, where the diversity of data is also linked to the multiple geographies involved. Searching for new markets becomes easier thanks to the combination of artificial intelligence and big data (Borghi & Mariani, 2020; Mariani, Baggio, Fuchs, & Höepken, 2018; Pillai et al., 2021), while communication capabilities are boosted through the adoption of digital marketing techniques that allow, as much as possible, the tailoring of both the product and the message offered to the potential customers.

The multiplication of channels for the retail industry has also brought significant challenges in the logistics domain. In this regard, the adoption of smart vehicles, reception boxes, and pick-up points (Mangiaracina, Perego, Seghezzi, & Tumino, 2019) can lead to increased efficiency and better service to customers, and seamless and transparent processes from the point of purchase to the time of delivery (Nguyen, de Leeuw, & Dullaert, 2018), fostering e-commerce success both within and across borders. Internet of Things applications allowing tracking of vehicles, monitoring of inventory, and warehouse robotics can also boost logistics performances and are becoming very widespread among major cross-border e-commerce logistics players, like Cainiao, the logistics arm of Alibaba Group (Rimmer & Kam, 2018).

Finally, many studies argue that for a successful digital transformation, companies need a supportive digital culture which is eventually nurtured when digital technologies are well integrated into business operations. If a virtuous cycle is created between technology adoption, technology integration, and the development of a digital culture, it will become easier to extend digital practices to different business functions, including the export department (Cassetta, Monarca, Dileo, Di Berardino, & Pini, 2020). In line with these arguments, we formulate the following hypothesis:

**H2:** Enterprises adopting digital technologies have a higher propensity to undertake digital export.

### 2.2.3. Human capital and digital capabilities as digital export drivers
People possess knowledge, skills, competences, education, and experience that have been defined as human capital (Becker, 1962), which is a critical firm’s resource to create value. For instance, workers’ human capital (HC) can enhance productivity, adding both tangible and intangible value to the firm (Hitt, Bierman, Shimizu, & Kochhar, 2001). Consequently, the decision to recruit from the market or develop HC internally (Hatch & Dyer, 2004) is based on a comparative assessment of the expected returns of workers’ productivity (Becker, 1964). However, firms do not own their HC, because it is embodied in their workers/employees, who are free to move from one firm to another (Becker, 1964; Hatch & Dyer, 2004). Accordingly, it is increasingly relevant for firms to attract, acquire, and retain talented workers as they can be conducive to effective digital transformation.

While IT was recognized as a relevant resource in the very seminal work of the RBV (Barney, 1991), we find that the examination of digital resources (i.e., digital technologies) and digital capabilities (i.e., the presence of an e-commerce manager) can make a difference for firms in gaining a competitive advantage in terms of digital export. Accordingly, this is the first study combining the RBV and firms’ capabilities to explain that to achieve an effective “digital transformation” under the guise of adoption of digital export, firms need both digital resources and digital capabilities, with the latter subsuming mere internet capabilities identified in previous internationalization studies (Gilavas & Mathews, 2014; Trainor et al., 2014).

Second, and related to the previous point, we show that digital resources (i.e., digital technologies) need to be integrated with digital capabilities to foster a firm-level “digital competitive advantage” which we propose as an extension of the examined competitive advantage enabled by IT (Pavlou & El Sawy, 2010).

Third, we also find that the amount of resources has a not significant impact, meaning that it is the quality rather than the quantity of resources that affects the propensity to digitally export, together with the digital capabilities. In other words, it is the heterogeneity across firms in terms of digital capabilities (as a result of the HC) that can help organizations that possess those valuable, rare, imperfectly imitable and non-substitutable digital technologies (Barney, 1991, 2001) to achieve high levels of digital export (Priem & Butler, 2001). Our additional evidence shows that the adoption of a digital export strategy is even more likely when firms have more than one digital technology, as they contribute to create digital synergies and complementarities and to form a digital corporate culture.

Fourth, we contribute to international business theory by shedding new light on digital internationalization (Alcacer et al., 2016) and suggesting that firms must possess an ownership advantage founded on both digital resources and digital capabilities to export in foreign markets using e-commerce. In other words, export being the first step of internationalization for several firms (Johanson & Vahlne, 2009), our results seem to suggest that firms can better manage the “liability of foreignness” arising from a digital export strategy by reducing their “liability of digitalness” through the development and combination of digital resources and capabilities.

Fifth, we contribute to the international entrepreneurship literature by answering the “urgent” call launched by Tolstoy et al. (2020) to investigate how firms (and SMEs in particular) can pursue new opportunities in a digital international business environment, by showing the strategic role of digital technologies and digital capabilities.

Sixth, we also enrich the work of Barus, Kosma, Whinston, and Yin (2004), who introduce the construct of online information capabilities, suggesting that today’s firms willing to go international need to build on digital capabilities, and the “reinvention of the company’s vision and strategy, organizational structure, processes, capabilities, and culture to match the evolving digital business context” (Gurbaxani & Dunkle, 2019: p. 209). The digital transformation has changed the way companies internationalize themselves but also redefined the markets and industries as customers and suppliers have undergone a digital transformation themselves and global value chains are now digitized.

Finally, we contribute to the ongoing debate of closing the marketing capability gap (Day, 2011) with an emphasis on the relevance of identifying skill gaps for export managers. In particular, we introduce the concept of “digital export capabilities” that can be described as the digital capabilities subsumed in managerial skills, competences, and knowledge that are embodied in the e-commerce manager professional and contribute to make a difference for digital export.

## 5.2. Practical implications
In terms managers should invest in both the adoption of digital technologies and in the development of digital skills if they aim to develop a competitive advantage to be used in digital export strategies.
