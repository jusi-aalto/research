## Abstract

Data breaches and security incidents have become commonplace, with thousands occurring each year and some costing hundreds of millions of dollars. Consequently, the market for insuring against these losses has grown rapidly in the past decade. While there exists much theoretical literature about cyber insurance, very little practical information is publicly available about the actual content of the polices and how carriers price cyber insurance premiums. This lack of transparency is especially troubling because insurance carriers are often cited as having the best information about cyber risk, and know how to assess – and differentiate – these risks across firms. In this qualitative research, we examined cyber insurance policies filed with state insurance commissioners and performed thematic (content) analysis to determine (i) what losses are covered by cyber insurance policies, and which are excluded?; (ii) what questions do carriers pose to applicants in order to assess risk?; and (iii) how are cyber insurance premiums determined – that is, what factors about the firm and its cybersecurity practices are used to compute the premiums? By analyzing these policies, we provide the first-ever systematic qualitative analysis of the underwriting process for cyber insurance and uncover how insurance companies understand and price cyber risks.

## Introduction

Data breaches and security incidents have become commonplace, with thousands occurring each year and some costing hundreds of millions of dollars. Consequently, the market for insuring against these losses has grown rapidly in the past decade. Cyber insurance is a broad term for insurance policies that address first and third party losses as a result of a computer-based attack or malfunction of a firm's information technology systems.

For example, one carrier's policy defines computer attacks as a, "hacking event or other instance of an unauthorized person gaining access to the computer system, [an] attack against the system by a virus or other malware, or [a] denial of service attack against the insured's system".

Although there exists a large, and growing, body of academic literature on cyber insurance, it is almost exclusively theoretical, examining network externalities, asymmetric information and the viability of cyber insurance markets. While this work is necessary for understanding the antecedents of market success and failure, it does not examine the actual legal contracts (the insurance policies) upon which the theories and models are based.

Further, while insurance companies are often seen as the singular organizations with specialized ability to quantify and price operational risks, there is almost no public information about how carriers actually assess – and differentiate – cyber risk across firms and industries, and particularly, how they compute prices for cyber insurance premiums. This lack of transparency in policies and practices is cited as one of the leading obstacles hindering adoption of cyber insurance.

## The market for cyber insurance

The US cyber insurance market has grown rapidly over the past decade. With less than $1 billion in premium in 2012, some experts estimate that the US cyber insurance market will grow to $7.5 billion by the end of the decade, with others projecting $20 billion by 2025. A recent survey of industry leaders found that 88% of respondents saw cyber as a "potentially huge untapped market" which they anticipated would grow faster than the rest of the property/casualty (P/C) insurance industry.

While the US market penetration may be more accelerated than other countries, only around one third of US companies have purchased some sort of cyber insurance, with significant variation in cyber insurance across US industry sectors. For example, barely 5% of manufacturing firms have cyber insurance coverage, whereas the healthcare, technology, and retail sectors have reached an adoption of close to 50%. Yet, Marsh reports cyber insurance growth rates of 27% across all industries, ranging from 6% in health care to 63% in manufacturing, for US-based clients in 2015.

The supply side of insurance is also growing very rapidly. While only a few firms were offering insurance products a decade ago, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) reported there to be around 500 carriers now offering cyber insurance. Reports suggest that the US cyber insurance market is dominated by a handful of carriers, including American International Group, Inc. (AIG), accounting for approximately 22% of the market, Chubb Limited (CB) at 12%, and XL Group Ltd. (XL) at 11%, with ACE Ltd, Zurich and Beazley also providing coverage.

Average premiums are priced between $10,000 and $25,000, with some carriers writing limits between $10 million and $25 million, and as high as $50 million. However, as with most other insurance products, towers of cyber policies can be purchased in the event of extreme losses, and Airmic suggests that limits of $200 million and $300 million exist for some industries.

## Related literature

This article is informed by two main streams of literature. The first is research on cyber insurance, which is almost exclusively theoretical. Overall, this body of work examines the incentives for firms to purchase insurance (demand side), the incentives for insurers to provide contracts (supply side), and the conditions necessary in order for a market to exist. The inevitable tension for firms, as many identify, is whether to invest in ex ante security controls in order to reduce the probability of loss, or to transfer the risk to an insurer.

Böhme and Schwartz provide an excellent summary of cyber insurance literature, and define a unified model of cyber insurance consisting of five components: the networked environment, demand side, supply side, information structure, and organizational environment. Here, the network topology plays a key role in affecting both interdependent security and correlated failures. Despite this body of work, however, none of it examines the form or content of actual insurance policies, or the pricing mechanism used by carriers.

In addition, there is some qualitative research on cyber insurance policies. Marotta et al. provide an overview of covered loss areas across 14 carriers. Majuca et al. mainly describe of the evolution of insurance policies since the late 1990s, as well provide an overview of covered losses from seven carriers, while Baer and Parkinson review policies from six carriers. And Woods et al. examine 24 self assessment questionnaires provided from insurance carriers.

## Research methodology and data collection

In the USA, insurance laws are statutorily enforced by the McCarran–Ferguson Act which empowers states to regulate the "business of insurance", and which is overseen by a nonprofit organization called the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC). In the 1990s, NAIC developed an online electronic records system called SERFF in order to facilitate the "submission, review and approval of product filings between regulators and insurance companies". The filed documents include the policy forms (description of coverage, triggers, and exclusions), application forms (the self-assessment questionnaires presented to clients in order to assess their security posture), rate information (equations and tables governing the pricing of premiums), and other supporting documentation required or requested by the state insurance commissioners.

There is a distinction regarding insurance regulation related to admitted versus nonadmitted markets. Carriers that seek to operate in an "admitted" market (which is the source of our data collection) must file their policies and rate schedules with the state insurance commissions and comply with all state regulations in order to be licensed in a given state. Alternatively, carriers may avoid some of the restrictions imposed by state insurance commissioners by selling insurance in the "nonadmitted" market (also known as excess or surplus insurance lines). While some suggest that a sizeable portion of US cyber insurance is sold in the nonadmitted market, the NIAC estimates that $1.8 billion in annual premiums is written in this admitted market.

### Sample selection

The goal of this research is to provide transparency around the three main components of cyber insurance policies: coverage and exclusions, security questionnaires, and rate schedules. We therefore leverage a form of qualitative research called directed content methodology, or thematic analysis, which enables us to identify and categorize themes and concepts, and derive meaning and insights across a collection of policies.

In order to determine the appropriate number of policies to examine, we employ a common form of qualitative nonprobabilistic sampling known as purposive sampling. Sample size in purposive sampling is determined by a concept called thematic saturation, which is the point at which "no additional data are being found whereby the (researcher) can develop properties of the category. As [the researcher] sees similar instances over and over again, [she] becomes empirically confident that a category is saturated".

We estimate the full population of cyber insurance policies to be around 2000–3000, a number larger than this research effort is able to examine. Analysis of state-level insurance regulation, as well as conversations with industry experts and regulators, suggests that for the purpose of this study, there should be no systematic variation across the states in the content of insurance policies.

For our data collection, we used the online SERFF system managed by NAIC to search for policies using the keywords: "cyber", "security", and "privacy". We limited the search to the broad category of property and casualty (P&C) insurance since "cyber insurance" is not covered under a single line of business, but instead is distributed across multiple lines of property and casualty insurance. We collected only "approved" documents, and omitted those which were filed but rejected. In total, we downloaded and examined 235 filing dockets from New York, Pennsylvania, and California. These states were chosen because they are three of the largest states by population, and where we therefore expect to see many policies with the most variation, thereby improving our thematic saturation.

The dockets covered years from 2007 to 2017, though not all 235 dockets contained all documents of interest for this research. The policies came from both large and small carriers, such as AXIS, Berkshire Hathaway, CUMIS, Chubb, Everest, Farmers, Federal Insurance Company, Great American, The Hartford Steam Boiler Inspection and Insurance Company, Philadelphia, QBE, Travelers, XL, Zurich, etc.

In addition, some large insurance carriers make their coverage and exclusion policies available online, and so we also collected policies from the public websites of 15 major insurance carriers. Security questionnaires and rate schedules were not available and therefore not included in our analysis.

## What losses do cyber insurance policies cover and exclude?

Cyber insurance, like most insurance products, generally distinguishes between two broad loss categories, "first party" and "third party". First party losses relate to those directly suffered by the insured (i.e. the "first" party to the insurance contract), while third party liability relates to claims brought by parties external to the contract (i.e. the "third" party) who suffer a loss allegedly due to the insured's conduct.

Of the 235 policy dockets collected from Pennsylvania, New York, and California, 54 had complete coverage and exclusion forms (2 of which were duplicate) filed between 2009 and 2016. In addition, we collected 15 coverage and exclusion forms posted by large insurance companies (from the nonadmitted market), for a total of 67 unique policies.

Our coding process for this section was as follows. For each policy, and for both coverage and exclusion sections, we coded each new criteria as they appeared, extending the codebook to capture the main components as necessary. Once complete, we identified a total of 17 covered losses, and 58 exclusions. As a validity check, 6 randomly selected policies (9%) were checked for accuracy. We achieved a reliability rate of 97% for covered losses and a reliability rate of 94% for exclusions.

As shown in Figure 1, we found that the covered losses appeared more consistent across all policies, whereas exclusions were more varied. For example, after reviewing only 6 policies, 88% of the covered losses had been coded, and by the 37th policy, we reached full saturation. By comparison, after 16 policies, we reached 71% saturation for exclusions, and achieved full saturation by the 60th policy.

We find the consistency in coverage across policies to be surprising. From discussions with industry experts, the consensus is that there is so much variation across policies that examining a sample would provide no meaningful insights in industry-wide coverage. The results presented above, however, suggest that there is, in fact, a strong similarity for both coverage and exclusions across many policies and these states.

### Covered losses

Coverage for losses due to cyber incidents can be categorized in a number of different ways, and one familiar way is to differentiate between losses borne as a direct result of the incident (first party losses), and losses incurred as a result of litigation by alleged injured parties (third party losses).

#### First party coverage

First party coverage includes losses incurred directly by the insured. For example, costs related to investigating the cause of a data breach or security incident, costs associated with restoring business services, the cost of notifying affected individuals, credit monitoring services, costs incurred from public relations and media services in order to communicate the event, extortion and ransom payments, and losses associated with business interruption.

In order to manage the various risks associated with these kinds of cyber incidents, carriers frequently assigned sublimits (and in some cases, distinct premiums), to groups of first party losses. For example, some policies differentiated among just a couple of categories, such as personal data compromise and computer attack. Personal data compromise relates to the "loss, theft, accidental release or accidental publication of personally identifying information (PII) or personally sensitive information". A computer attack relates to unauthorized access, malware attack, or denial of service (DoS) attack on any computer or electronic hardware owned or leased and operated by the policy holder.

More sophisticated – or perhaps, risk averse – policies differentiated among more coverage areas, each with their own sublimits. For example, POL-30 distinguished among the following groups:

**Table 1: First party coverage sublimits**

| Coverage area | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| Data Compromise Response | Provides coverage for specified expenses arising from a personal data compromise involving personally identifying information of affected individuals. Affected individuals may be customers, clients, members, directors or employees of the insured entity. |
| Identity Recovery | Provides coverage for Identity Recovery caused by an identity theft of an identity recovery insured first discovered during the policy period. |
| Computer Attack | Provides coverage for specified expenses arising from a computer attack on the computer system. |
| Cyber Extortion | Provides coverage for the cost of an investigator retained in connection with the extortion threat and coverage for any amount paid by the insured in response to the threat. |

#### Third party liability coverage

Third party liability covers the cost of defending against public or private litigation, settlements, judgments, or other rulings, as well as fines, fees, and settlements stemming from these lawsuits. For example, POL-35's network security liability coverage covers costs due to, "a civil action, an alternate dispute, a resolution proceeding or a written demand for money" as a result of "a [t]he breach of third party business information, [t]he unintended propagation or forwarding of malware, [t]he unintended abetting of a denial of service attack".

Similarly with first party losses, coverage is available, and limits are distributed, across multiple kinds of claims. For example POL-30 distinguished between liability (brought by either a private or public action) due to a data compromise, network security incident, and electronic media:

**Table 2: Third party liability sublimits**

| Liability | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Data Compromise | [Provides] coverage for defense and settlement costs in the event that affected individuals or a government entity sue the insured because of a personal data compromise. |
| Network Security | Provides coverage for defense and settlement costs in the event that a third party claimant sues the insured because of: • The breach of third party business information • The unintended propagation or forwarding of malware • The unintended abetting of a denial of service attack • The inability of an authorized third party user to access the insured's computer system. |
| Electronic Media | Provides coverage for defense and settlement costs in the event that a third party claimant sues the insured alleging that the insured's electronic communications resulted in defamation, violation of a person's right of privacy, interference with a person's right of publicity or infringement of copyright or trademark. |

### Most common covered losses

Figure 2 shows the top 10 most common covered losses.

Beyond the generalities defined above, below we describe a number of notable categories from the analysis.

**Cost of claims expenses, penalties**
This includes legal claims expenses related to penalties, defense and settlement costs. For example, POL-20 expressed how expenses would be paid for violation of timely disclosure of breach notice laws, regulatory and defense penalties, payment card (PCI) Fines, claims against the reputation of anyone or any organization, the invasion of privacy, or any claims against website content to include copyright and plagiarism.

**Public relations services**
Coverage for public relations (PR) costs appeared in the vast majority of policies, though sometimes came with restrictions. For example, some policies only covered costs associated with advertising or special promotions, or in situations when a data privacy wrongful act had occurred, while other policies limited the total dollar amount of coverage, or excluded any costs directed to employees, or when affected individuals had already been notified.

**Notification to affected individuals (e.g. credit monitoring)**
Some policies are specific in terms of the kinds of services that can be provided to affected individuals – supplying a list of programs from which the policyholder must choose. For example, POL-22 requires that credit monitoring, identity monitoring, and fraud resolution services coverage only apply if Experian is used (specifically, Experian's ProtectMyID Alert, Family Secure, and DataPatrol).

**Computer forensic investigation costs**
Expenses for computer forensic services (i.e. examining computer systems for indicators of malware or malicious activity) sometimes included the costs of computer expert services, and POL-22 noted that these expenses are specifically to be used in the case of disclosure of personally identifiable information (PII).

**Items both covered and excluded**
While about two-thirds of the policies covered expenses for data restoration, data re-creation, and system restoration, others explicitly excluded costs incurred to examine or correct a deficiency. For example, "cost[s] to research or correct any deficiency" (POL-49), or costs associated with the inspection, upgrading, maintenance, repair, or remediation of a computer system.

### Exclusions

Figure 3 shows the 10 most common exclusions among the policies examined.

The exclusions most commonly observed were those not necessarily directly related to the cyber realm, but instead criminal, fraudulent, or dishonest acts, errors or omissions, intentional violation of a law, any ongoing criminal investigation or proceedings, and payment of fines, penalties, or fees. Several policies provide additional exclusions for infringement of patents, disclosures of trade secrets or confidential information, or violations of securities laws.

Other exclusions related to matters of physical harm (e.g. bodily injury, electric or mechanical failure, fire, smoke, wind or Act of God, release of pollutants), aspects of liability suits (e.g. nonmonetary relief, and expenses resulting from the propagation or forwarding of malware on hardware or software created, produced, or modified by the policy holder for sale, damages related to employment discrimination, contractual liability, theft of intellectual property), and losses to systems out of the policyholder's control (e.g. loss to the Internet, ISP, computer, or system not owned or operated by the policyholder).

Other rare but notable exclusions included, collateral damage (i.e. malware, denial of service attack, or intrusion not directly aimed at the policyholder), failure to disclose a loss of PII if an executive of the firm was aware of such a loss, and salaries, benefits, expenses of employees.

While we found no substantial differences in coverage between state policies and those of large carriers, there were some differences in exclusions, as shown in Table 3.

**Table 3: Exclusions found more commonly/rarely in large carriers vs. state policies**

| Rarely seen in large carriers | More common in large carriers |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| • Cost to research/correct deficiency | • Property damage |
| • Suit from propagation or forwarding of malware | • Seizure/destruction of systems/data by government |
| • Nonmonetary relief | • Natural elements |
| | • Unlawful collection or sale of information |
| | • Unsolicited dissemination of communication |
| | • Unfair trade |
| | • Intellectual property theft |

## Security questionnaires

The next component of cyber insurance policies to be examined is the security questionnaires. These questionnaires are provided by the carriers, and are ostensibly designed to solicit a comprehensive understanding of (or at least reasonable approximation to) the overall security posture of the applicant. Moreover, the questions should help to "differentiate" risks across a portfolio of applicants.

Of the 235 insurance dockets we downloaded and analyzed, 31 had questionnaires. In eight cases, multiple questionnaires were included in a policy and in cases where the questionnaires were distinct, they were coded separately, generating a total of 45 questionnaires. We then found 11 cases of duplicate questionnaires, which we omitted from the analysis. This resulted in 34 unique, coded questionnaires.

In total, we identified 118 different topics, some of which were very detailed while others were quite broad. However, many questions expressed similar themes, such as those pertaining to business information, data type, and questions regarding the compliance with PCI/DSS standards or the deployment of antivirus systems. Therefore, the 118 unique topics were organized into 14 subcategories, from which 4 main themes were created: Organizational, Technical, Policies and Procedures, and Legal and Compliance.

Figure 4 illustrates the number of questions for each subcategory. Overall, the Organization category had 35 questions, the Technical category had 21, and the Policies and Procedures and Legal and Compliance had 51 and 11 questions, respectively.

As shown in the left panel of Figure 5, after reviewing just 3 questionnaires, 78% of all 118 questions had been coded, and by the 23rd questionnaire, we achieved 100% saturation. In regard to the "total" number of questions per document, there was considerable variation as shown in the right panel of Figure 5. In some cases, the questionnaires were quite long, with almost 70 questions, whereas others only included a few (the median number of questions was 26).

### Organizational

#### Organization

The applications typically begin by collecting basic information about the company, such as the type of business and the industry sector in which the company operates, as well as financial information about revenues and assets. In a few cases, the questionnaires asked the company to submit an audited annual statement.

To assess the operation of a business, POL-9 and POL-5 gathered information about the applicants' clients, including questions about the largest and most significant clients, the size of their contracts, and the duration of the project and relationship with the clients.

Information is also collected about the company's past and current insurance coverage, including selected deductibles, and exclusions, if applicable.

#### Data collection and handling

There was a concerted effort to understand the kinds of sensitive or confidential information that the applicant collects, stores, processes, or for which it is otherwise responsible. Of particular interest is PII, confidential client information, or corporate intellectual property, such as SSN, credit/debit card numbers, driver license, email addresses, IP addresses, financial and banking information, medical records, protected health information (PHI) as well as intellectual property, and trade secrets.

In comparison with the "technology and infrastructure" category these questions focus on the kind of data an applicant is managing. This suggests that carriers focus on data and the potential loss at risk. This possibly explains why relatively little information is collected about the technology and infrastructure landscape, or at least suggests that this category is less relevant when assessing an applicant's risk of filing a claim.

#### Outsourcing

Questionnaires also addressed how the applicant manages its relationships with outsourcing providers and the services the applicant relies on to conduct business. Given that it is common to outsource services and use third party service providers, these questions were relatively common. Questionnaires asked the insured to list the outsourced services and provide the names of providers, and some even provided a comprehensive list for the applicant to select.

Questionnaires further assessed whether a security, privacy, and/or risk assessment was performed on the third party provider. The history of the third party providers is assessed, with regard to whether they were subject to privacy or security breaches in the past. Further, contracts between the insured and the third party were examined, such as whether they were structured in a way to hold third parties liable for losses resulting from data and security breaches, or whether they included an indemnity clause to transfer risk to a third party.

#### Incident loss history

In almost all questionnaires, the insurer collected information about the applicant's experience with regard to past security incidents. While the formulation and framing of the questions varied across the questionnaires, in essence, the following issues were addressed: (i) past data and security breaches and their impact; (ii) privacy breaches and loss of confidential information that triggered the notification of customers and/or employees; (iii) circumstances that could lead to an insurance claim; (iv) lawsuits and claims that are the result of an IP infringement; (v) extortions through the means of cyber, investigations by a regulatory or administrative agency.

#### IT security budget and spending

IT security budget and spending provides insights into how much an insured invests in its information and IT security. However, IT security budgeting and spending was addressed in one questionnaire, only. POL-18 asked "What is the Applicant's aggregated budget for system security" and "How is the system security budget allocated among: (a) prevention of security incidents; (b) detection of security incidents; (c) response in security incidents, all in percentage".

### Technical

#### Information technology and computing infrastructure

Understanding the technology and infrastructure landscape of an insured would seem to be a relevant factor to consider in the risk assessment. Yet, only a few insurers cover this aspect in their questionnaire. When they did, only a few questions were posed, such as the number of computing devices, the number of IP addresses, or websites.

Information about the technology and infrastructure landscape would clearly help a carrier understand, if only at a basic level, the overall attack surface of a potential insured and, with more information, help assess their overall information security risk posture. However, it seems that only very rudimentary information is collected.

#### Technical security measures

Questions regarding technical measures to protect against data theft and intrusions were found in most questionnaires. These included questions concerning the kinds of tools used to secure the applicant's networks and computers, including antivirus software to perform scans on email, downloads, and devices to detect malicious files or processes; IDS/IPS to detect possible intrusions and abnormalities in networks; and firewalls.

Encryption for data at rest and in motion was a technical measure that was often mentioned in the questionnaires. Some questions also focused on mobile devices, while VPN and two-factor authentication were less frequently listed as technical measures.

#### Access control

Access control addresses the means and policies to secure user access, including the assignment of designated rights for users to resources. It attempts to restrict the access to sensitive data on a need to know basis. Beyond matters of access and users rights/privileges, questionnaires addressed whether processes were in place to revoke user rights and privileges once users terminated or left the organization.

Furthermore, this includes the monitoring of unauthorized access to or large download of sensitive data, as well as remote shutdown and data wipe out capabilities for computers.

### Policies and procedures

#### Information and data management

This category includes questions with regard to the applicant's data management practices – the number of records held, whether the applicant sells or shares sensitive information (i.e. PII) with third parties, and whether it processes information for third parties, including the processing or storing of credit or debit card transactions.

The most common question in this category was whether a data retention and destruction policy existed. Interestingly, the questions do not exclusively address digital data, but rather, data management is conceived more broadly to also include written records that warrant protection.

The need for a corporate policy for record and information management and a classification system that determines what data must be protected was only expressed in a few questionnaires. In only one instance, did an application inquire whether the responsibility for records and information management was assigned to a senior executive.

#### Employee, privacy, and network security subcategories

Questions concerning an applicant's privacy policy, and information and network security policy were common but varied in detail. In some instances, the questionnaires assessed details of how a policy was implemented and tested, and whether a policy was reviewed by the legal counsel and approved by the board of directors.

While privacy, and information and network security policies were the most common policies mentioned in the surveyed questionnaires, usage policies for the internet, social networking, and/or email were mentioned. Less common were policies for software development (i.e. the use of secure coding standards) and password policies (e.g. the use of strong encryption).

However, aside from these, the questions did not cover the substance of a particular policy (i.e. what should be in those policies, and how should they regulate particular issues) but rather only tested their existence. In numerous cases, the questionnaires asked whether the responsibility of privacy and information and network security and their respective policies are assigned or "owned" by a Chief Privacy Officer (CPO) role and a Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) role, respectively.

#### Organizational security policies and procedures

In addition to technical measures that are implemented to protect the information system in the daily business operation, organizational measures and procedures describe a set of measures to maintain and strengthen information security. Questions in this category related to penetration testing, vulnerability scanning, assessment, and management. Further, questions related to security and privacy assessment conducted by internal first parties or external third parties were asked, as were measures with regard to physical security (e.g. physical access control to computing facilities).

Several questionnaires assessed whether a business continuity plan (BCP), disaster recovery plan, as well as an incident response plan (IRP) were in place. Extended questions were concerned about the assignment of, and approval by, senior executives for the BCP and IRP. Further questions addressed data backup procedures as well as training with regard to information security procedures.

### Legal and compliance

Over the years, a variety of laws and regulations on the federal and state level, as well as industry standards have emerged that aim to protect consumers from the consequences of cyber incidents and data breaches. These laws, regulations, and standards are widely acknowledged in the questionnaires. Almost every questionnaire includes language about HIPAA, PCI/DSS, and GLBA, but also other US federal and state laws. In some but not all cases, the questionnaires ask to provide metrics about how well the respective standards are implemented and adhered to.

PCI/DSS as an industry standard for payment processing was prominent in many questionnaires. Further, questions concerning PCI/DSS commonly exhibit a significant amount of detail. For example, one insurer asks: "How many credit or debit card transactions does the Applicant process annually?" and then continues to collect information about whether the applicant: "(a) Mask[s] all but the last four digits of a card number when displaying or printing cardholder data; (b) Ensure[s] that card-validation codes are not stored in any of the Applicant's databases, log files or anywhere else within the Applicant's network; (c) Encrypt[s] all account information on the Applicant's databases; (d) Encrypt[s] or use tokenization for all account information at the point of sale; or (e) Employ[s] point-to-point encryption, starting with card swipe hardware."

### Summary

So far, this analysis begins to provide transparency into the information that carriers are concerned about when assessing cyber risk. For example, we observe an emphasis on the amount of data (i.e. number of records) and the type of data (i.e. sensitive and confidential data) managed by the firm. The focus on sensitive data, particularly those to debit and credit card transactions and the detailed questions concerning PCI/DSS standard compliance is not surprising given that in the past decade data protection industry standards and data breach laws have developed and have been widely institutionalized in the USA.

On the other hand, there is little attention given to the technical and business infrastructure, and their interdependencies with environment in which the applicant is operating. These rather technical areas could provide further insights into the risk situation and security posture of an applicant. With regard to organizational processes and practices, it was surprising that risk management and IT security management as corporate functions and processes did not receive more attention.

It is noteworthy, however, that standards and frameworks for information technology management, such as the ITIL and COBIT are not mentioned, and in only one instance was an ISO standard mentioned. Also, the recently developed NIST Cybersecurity framework is not mentioned, though from conversations with carriers, they are beginning to integrate it into these questionnaires.

Only in one instance, did a questionnaire asked about the size of the IT/information security budget and how it is spent with regard to prevention, detection, and response to security incidents. This finding was surprising given the amount of money spent on IT and information security could serve as a useful indicator for security maturity.

## How do carriers price cyber insurance?

We mentioned earlier that insurance is regulated at the state level, and state laws require that insurance rates are not "excessive, inadequate, or unfairly discriminatory". "Excessive" implies that the premiums are not priced unreasonably high, "adequacy" implies that the premiums are high enough in order to support the business for the carrier, and "discriminatory" implies that any price differences appropriately reflect variation in actual risk across firms. But what are firms charging, and how do carriers determine these prices?

In this section, we examine the forms and equations used by insurance carriers to price cyber risks (formally known as "rate schedules"). We first examine justifications that carriers provide to state auditors when determining pricing policies, and then analyze the pricing schemes used to compute premiums. We conclude this section by showing the actual equations used to derive those premiums.

### How much do carriers know about cyber risk?

Of the 235 dockets examined, 56 included explanations for the state insurance auditor concerning the carrier's approach for deriving premiums. It is in these documents that we observe the process by which insurance pricing is conducted, and what information carriers may have in order to price cyber risk. From our analysis, we detected five main themes that carriers used for determining prices: (i) relied on external sources, (ii) estimated or guessed, (iii) looked to competitors, (iv) leveraged the experience of their own underwriters, and (v) adapted prices from other insurance lines.

Overall, many carriers began by stating how "cyber" is a relatively new insurance line, and that they have no historic or credible data upon which to make reliable inferences about loss expectations (e.g. "Limitations of available data have constrained the traditional actuarial methods used to support rates", POL-11).

In a number of cases, though, carriers employed the services of other companies to help develop premiums, or additionally it collected industry, academic, or government reports themselves that contained basic loss data. For example, POL-50 stated:

> Frequency was derived from data gathered from the 2011 Computer Security Institute Computer Crime and Security Survey and from the HSB/Ponemon survey. Severities were calculated for three of the sub-coverages (data restoration, data recreation and systems restoration) using data drawn from the HSB/Ponemon survey and from the 2003 Graziado Business Review which were then combined with dollar amounts that represented the costs of repairing various kinds of covered damages. These costs were obtained from a variety of IT repair resources, including surveys and published rates.

In other cases, carriers used other public information, which was augmented with additional sources or their own, limited experience. For example one carrier wrote, "We reviewed the rates for a less robust cyber product developed by Hartford Steam Boiler ('HSB') for the same types of accounts we are targeting[,] and then at a composite rate of the carriers writing more expansive cyber coverage for larger and more technologically sophisticated accounts. These two rates then became the two outside points of reference for establishing our rates" (POL-61).

Or, in some cases, the carrier would appear to guess [e.g. "The base retentions were set at what we believe to be an appropriate level for the relative size of each insured" (POL-6)], while many carriers employed what (limited) experience they had (e.g. "Rates for this coverage have been developed based upon the experience and judgment of our underwriters, claims personnel, and actuaries" (POL-25).

Further, in a number of occasions, we observed that carriers based their rates on the pricing of their competitors. For example, POL-36 states "the rates for the above-mentioned coverages have been developed by analyzing the rates of the main competitors as well as by utilizing our own judgment", and POL-31 states, "the program base rates and rating variables were based on a competitive review of the marketplace and underwriting judgment". While this may seem like an odd practice, discussion with insurance professionals suggest that this is, indeed, a common and appropriate occurrence.

In only a few cases were carriers confident enough in their own experience to develop pricing models, for example, one carrier wrote, "Underwriters collectively have over 40 years' experience in e-commerce, cyber, privacy and network security liability insurance. The collective knowledge of underwriters, including a deep understanding of competitive rates and feedback from the wholesale and retail brokerage industry, was used to establish rates for the program" (POL-2).

In a number of instances, we observed how carriers would turn to other insurance lines to price premiums because of their lack of data. One carrier admitted, "We are not using claim counts as the basis for credibility because we have not experienced any claims over the past three years" (POL-73). And in such cases carriers would base cyber risks on other insurance lines. For example, "Loss trend was determined by examining 10 years of countrywide Fiduciary frequency and severity trends. Because CyberRisk is a developing coverage we chose to use Fiduciary liability data because it has a similar limit profile and expected development pattern" (POL-43).

### How do carriers assess cyber risk?

Of the 235 total policies examined, 72 contained a rate schedule, 3 of which were duplicates. The 69 remaining forms were then segmented into 4 categories according to how they priced the premium. First, we distinguished between "flat rate pricing", and "base rate pricing". The flat rate pricing approach, as the name suggests, provides a single rate to all insured, regardless of their size, or any specific security controls by the insured, while the "base rate" pricing approach uses a series of lookup tables and modifiers to compute the premium, such as modifiers relating to the applicant's standard insurance criteria (e.g. limits, retention, claims history, etc.), and the applicant's industry. In addition, for each of the flat rate and base rate pricing structures, we also identified policies that incorporated either basic hazard metric (coded as "flat rate with hazard groups"), or information about the firm's security technologies, practices, and procedures (coded as "base rate with security questions").

The relative distribution of categories from our dataset is shown in Figure 6. Overall, there were 15 flat rate policies with 4 more that also used hazard groups (for a total of 19 flat rate policies). Of the base rate policies, there were 11 standard base rate policies, and an additional 39 that incorporated questions related to the firm's security posture (for a total of 50 base rate policies).

#### Flat rate

The simplest approach to computing premiums was a fixed price for first and third party coverage to all insureds. While this approach offers a quick method for establishing premiums, it affords no differentiation by firm or industry. We found these polices generally offered to smaller companies. For example the CyberOne policy, developed by Insurance Services Organization (ISO), is used by many smaller insurance companies and offers first- and third-party premiums as shown in Table 4.

**Table 4: Simple rate development**

| Coverage | Frequency | Severity | Expected loss (lost cost) | Profit load | Premium |
|----------|-----------|----------|---------------------------|-------------|---------|
| Computer attack | 0.20% | $49,800 | $99.60 | 35% | $153 |
| Network security liability | 0.17% | $86,100 | $147.23 | 35% | $227 |

The frequency column reflects the probability of a given loss event, computed annually, while the severity reflects (presumably) the mean annual loss. The expected loss column is the product of the first two columns, and the profit load is the standard method by which insurance carriers cover costs and expenses. Note that while this approach was used by many carriers, there was some variation across carriers with regard to the frequency, severity, profit loading, and therefore premiums as they incorporated other information.

For context, in other research that examined the cost of cyber incidents, the median cost was found to be $170,000, with a probability of loss around 0.6% across the top 10 most risky industries, producing an expected loss of $1020 – considerably higher than the values shown above.

Overall, this approach is simple and straightforward. However, it relies entirely on estimates of frequency and severity of cyber events and litigation costs.

#### Flat rate with hazard groups

Even though only four policies we encountered fit into this category, we include it here for completeness. As with the standard flat rate policies, these policies define a fixed price premium, but with a single modifier based on a generic hazard group assigned by business type (again, typically for small businesses). For example, POL-46 described the following hazard groups:

- "Low Hazard – Insured has a website for informational purposes only or small amounts of sales from manufacturers whose main distribution channel is through retailers.
- Medium Hazard – Insured conducts business, at least partially, over their website and/or retain credit card numbers as well as other potentially sensitive information.
- High Hazard – Insured conducts a potentially large portion of their business through their website or retain sensitive information such as social security numbers or have some combination of both."

Examples of low hazard businesses, per this policy, were accounting offices, automobile shops and barber shops, while businesses considered high hazard were electronics stores, and home improvement stores.

#### Base rate

As mentioned, 50 of the policies in our dataset used a base rate pricing model. That is, the base premium is assessed as a function of the insured's annual revenues or assets (or, with some niche products, number of employees or students). This base premium is then multiplied by variables relating to standard insurance and industry-related factors. We describe the base rate approach first, followed by the standard insurance properties, and then the industry-related factors.

The factor that assigns the greatest influence on the premium is the base asset value or revenues of the applicant's firm. For example, Table 5 provides one example of how a policy initially defines the premiums, as a function of firm revenue.

**Table 5: Base premiums by revenue**

| Revenue (in millions) | Annual gross base premiums |
|----------------------|---------------------------|
| $0–$10 | $1913.91 |
| $10–$20 | $2602.92 |
| $20–$50 | $3502.46 |
| $50–$100 | $5224.98 |

And Table 6 shows premiums with associated retention (deductible) by asset size for POL-6.

**Table 6: Retention by asset size**

| Asset size (in millions) | Base rate | Base retention |
|-------------------------|-----------|----------------|
| to $100 | $5000 | $25,000 |
| $100 to $250 | $7000 | $25,000 |
| $250 to $500 | $8500 | $50,000 |
| $500 to $1000 | $11,000 | $100,000 |
| $1000 to $2500 | $14,000 | $150,000 |
| $2500 to $5000 | $16,500 | $250,000 |
| $5000 to $10,000 | $20,000 | $250,000 |
| $10,000 to $25,000 | $26,000 | $500,000 |
| $25,000 to $50,000 | $35,000 | $500,000 |
| $50,000 to $75,000 | $41,000 | $1,000,000 |
| $75,000 to $100,000 | $45,000 | $1,000,000 |

Table 7 provides a sense of the variation in premiums found in our analysis across carriers, for a firm with $100 million in sales (or assets), a $1 million limit and $10,000 deductible.

**Table 7: Variation in premiums for $100m in sales or assets**

| Policy | Premium |
|--------|---------|
| POL-55 | $3300 |
| POL-41 | $3500 |
| POL-56 | $3965 |
| POL-37 | $4000 |
| POL-6 | $5000 |
| POL-88 | $6,000 |
| POL-32 | $7500 |
| POL-33 | $42,000 |

##### Standard insurance factors

Standard insurance factors include variables such as changes to the limits or deductible (retention) of a policy. For example, the greater the limits, or the smaller the deductible, the larger will be the premium, as shown in Table 8.

**Table 8: Limits factor**

| Limits | Factor |
|--------|--------|
| $500,000 | 0.809 |
| $1,000,000 | 1.000 |
| $2,000,000 | 1.132 |
| $3,000,000 | 1.245 |
| $4,000,000 | 1.371 |
| $5,000,000 | 1.405 |

In addition, the premium will be modified based on factors such as coinsurance, time retention, prior acts, extended reporting period, and business interruption. Historical claims refers to the number of times the insured has suffered an incident and filed a claim in past years. Premiums typically increase about 10% for each event. However, one carrier (POL-33) provides a more descriptive offering for claims history, as shown in Table 9.

**Table 9: Claims history**

| Category | Min | Max |
|----------|-----|-----|
| Very favorable | 0.75 | 0.85 |
| Favorable | 0.9 | 0.99 |
| Average | 1.0 | 1.0 |
| Slightly unfavorable | 1.01 | 1.15 |
| Materially unfavorable | 1.16 | 1.25 |
| Very unfavorable | 1.26 | 1.4 |
| Extremely unfavorable | 1.41 | 1.7 |

Here, the min and max values provide a range of pricing modifiers for the insurance underwriters based on a list of considerations defined in the policy.

A few policies provided coverage for business interruption in the event of a data breach or security incident. For example, POL-2 defined the additional cost of business interruption as shown in Table 10.

**Table 10: Business interruption**

| Industry | Waiting period (hour) | Business interruption charge (%) |
|----------|----------------------|----------------------------------|
| Auto dealership | 10 | 10.0 |
| Automotive services | 10 | 10.0 |
| Domestic services (e.g. plumbers, electricians, gardeners) | 8 | 5.0 |
| E-commerce | 24 | 50.0 |
| Education – colleges/universities/higher education | 8 | 5.0 |
| Professional services (excluding legal services) | 12 | 25.0 |
| Realtor – commercial/residential | 10 | 10.0 |
| Restaurant | 10 | 10.0 |
| Retail | 24 | 50.0 |
| Sports clubs/gyms | 8 | 5.0 |
| Telecommunications | 24 | 50.0 |

##### Industry classification

Next, carriers attempt to control for risks to the insured based on the industry in which it operates. However, from the policies examined in this research, there was no consistency regarding approach, or any consensus on what the insurance industry would consider the "most" risky.

POL-18 assigns the energy, entertainment and hospitality sectors a weighting of 1.0 (meaning no adjustment – essentially neutral risk), while firms in the accounting, advertising, construction, manufacturing industries receive a weighting of 0.85 (less risky), and firms in the bio-tech, data aggregation, gaming, and public sectors receive a weighting of 1.2 (more risky). How these relative weightings are determined is unclear and never described in the policies we examined.

Another carrier distinguished among four hazard classes with premium modifiers as shown in Table 11.

**Table 11: Four hazard classes**

| Class | Description | Factor |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | Businesses whose primary personal information is relative to employees | 0.804 |
| 2 | Businesses that keep financial or account number information on individual customers but do not keep customers' Social Security numbers | 1.000 |
| 3 | Businesses with customers' Social Security numbers | 1.497 |
| 4 | Entities that collect and store a high volume of particularly sensitive personal information, are at high risk of loss or theft of that information and are subject to structural restraints on their security spending | 1.905 |

Notice how Class 2 (firms which process financial information) is assigned the datum, implicitly stating that SSN and high volume transaction information are considered more risky. Further, notice that four significant digits are used for these factor weightings. It is unclear how these figures were derived, or whether such precision at all accurately reflects true risk.

Another carrier (POL-32) takes a more aggregate approach by differentiating nonprofit, for-profit, and only a few other industries, as shown in Table 12.

**Table 12: Industry risk**

| Industry classification factor | Weighting |
|-------------------------------|-----------|
| Nonprofit, nonmedical | 1.0 |
| For profit, manufacturer | 1.5 |
| For profit, wholesale | 1.5 |
| For profit, nontechnical service provider | 1.5 |
| Computer consultants | 2.0 |
| System integration | 2.0 |
| Software manufacturer | 2.0 |
| Retail | 3.0 |
| Healthcare | 3.0 |
| Accountants | 3.0 |
| Financial | 4.0 |
| Large risk (over $250M revenue) | 5.0 |
| All other | 3.0 |

#### Base rate with security questions

The most sophisticated approach used by 39 (57% of) policies examined in our dataset accounted for characteristics of the applicant's information security controls when determining the final premium pricing. Adjustments based on the applicant's actual security posture vary widely across polices, ranging from basic risk categories to more detailed metrics. One very simple approach (POL-44) considers broad categories of data protection, and adjusts based on qualitative ratings above or below what one may consider to be "average" maturity of controls, as shown in Table 13.

**Table 13: Basic security modifiers**

| Category | Modification |
|----------|--------------|
| | Below Avg | Avg | Above Avg |
| Privacy controls | 1.20 | 1.00 | 0.80 |
| Network security controls | 1.20 | 1.00 | 0.80 |
| Content liability controls | 1.20 | 1.00 | 0.80 |
| Laptop and mobile device security policy | 1.10 | 1.00 | 0.90 |
| Incident response plan | 1.10 | 1.00 | 0.90 |

While simple (and possibly appropriate), this particular policy provides no guidance on how an underwriter is supposed to assess an applicant based on these properties.

A slightly more detailed and thoughtful approach was found in POL-64 which differentiates a firm's overall security posture along six dimensions (factors): data classification, security infrastructure, governance, risk and compliance, payment card control, media controls, and computer system interruption loss. Each factor provided four qualitative options (poor, fair, good, excellent) with a weighting as shown in Table 14.

**Table 14: Security factor weighting**

| Rating | Weighting |
|--------|-----------|
| Excellent | 0.75–0.85 |
| Good | 0.85–1.00 |
| Fair | 1.00–1.25 |
| Poor | 1.25–1.50 |

The benefit of this approach relative to other simpler or more complex approaches is that it affords a reasonable tradeoff between specificity and practicality. This approach affords the underwriter the ability to investigate a firm's controls and make reasonable assessments. This policy also intelligently provides useful scoring rubrics for each category.

Other policies took a different approach and adjusted the premium based on the firm's responses to questions from the security questionnaire. For example, POL-6 included the following adjustments:

"(3) Is the disaster recovery plan tested at least annually? Answer YES to Factor
Three of the above questions 0.80 to 0.90
Two of the above questions 0.91 to 0.99
One of the above questions 1.00 to 1.05
None of the above questions 1.06 to 1.15

(4) Did the total number of targeted computer attacks increase, decrease or remain unchanged in the past 2 years? Factor
Decrease 0.85 to 0.95
Unchanged 1.00
Increase 1.10 to 1.20

(5) Are penetration tests conducted on the insured's network at least annually? Factor
Yes 0.85 to 0.95
No 1.10 to 1.20"

### How are premiums finally computed?

From the policies examined (excluding for the flat rate pricing policies), once the base asset/revenue value is determined, the final premium is computed as the linear product of each of the factors contained in the rate schedule. POL-20 describes the process as, "Pricing is calculated by applying modification factors to a base premium. The modification factors are determined by various criteria including the Limit of Liability and Deductible purchased, the coverage enhancements or restrictions negotiated with the insured, and the risk's financial characteristics. All modification factors are multiplicative, unless otherwise indicated".

As previously described, some policies may only consider a few factors, while others may include many. For example, the premium in POL-20 is computed as:

Premium = [Base Premium] x
[Loss Rating] x
[Professional Experience] x
[Longevity of Operations] x
[Use of Written Contracts] x
[Risk Characteristics] x
[Prior Acts Factor] x
[Coverage Adjustment] x
[Deductible]

While the formula in POL-6 is composed of 6 groups of factors and 13 separate security-related questions, producing a final expression of:

Premium = (Section 1 Base Rate) x
(Section 2 Industry Factor) x
(Section 3.1 Increased Limits Factor) x
(Section 3.2 Retention Factor) x
(Section 3.3 Coinsurance Factor) x
(Section 6 Third-Party Modifier Factors)

POL-100 further extends expands the security properties, producing the following expression:

Final Premium = (Third Party Liability Base Rate) +
(First Party Costs Base Rate, if elected) x
(Limit Factor) x
(Retention Factor) x
(Data Classification Factor) x
(Security Infrastructure Factor) x
(Governance, Risk and Compliance Factor) x
(Payment Card Controls Factor) x
(Media Controls Factor) x
(Computer System Interruption Loss Factor, if applicable) x
(Retroactive Coverage Factor) x
(Claims/Loss History Factor) x
(Endorsements Factor, if applicable)

### Summary

In this section, we examined a sample of cyber insurance rate schedules and achieved three main insights. First, we provide exposure of how insurance carriers justify the prices they charge, and what, exactly, they know (and do not know) about how to price cyber risk (i.e. guessing, using competitor pricing, leveraging other lines of business). Second, we identified the pricing strategies used by carriers (flat rate, flat rate with hazard groups, base rate, and base rate with security questions), and third, we provide transparency regarding the factors used by carriers in pricing risk (base rate, industry, and a series of data security and privacy modifiers), and presented the actual algorithms used to price premiums.

From our analysis, the first and most important firm characteristic used to compute insurance premiums was the firm's asset value (or revenue) base rate, rather than specific technology or governance controls. This appears to be the single most common proxy for firm size, and therefore risk.

While some carriers have sophisticated algorithms for premium estimates, policies that cater to small business are very simple. In addition, premiums that capture third party losses (i.e. liability coverage) are generally more costly than those associated with first party losses, suggesting that carriers expect legal actions to be more expensive relative to direct losses suffered by the insured.

While a few carriers incorporate specific information collected from the policy's security self-assessment forms, many policies used more generic security risk categories (e.g. high, med, low). And while many policies incorporate industry factors into the underwriting process, no explanation or justification for how the actual risk weighting is provided. Further, the industries listed rarely match standard coding schemes like SIC or NAICS.

Beyond the specific equations, however, it is unclear which level of sophistication of premium calculation is optimal for the firm, and is best able to assess an applicant's risk. Indeed, this remains an outstanding issue among carriers.

## Limitations

There are a number of important limitations to this research. First, our analysis and conclusions reflect results based a sample of all insurance policies covered in the USA. Naturally, this suggests that further analysis incorporating more policies across more states may reveal additional or even different results. However, that being said, based on our previous examination of state regulations pertaining to the insurance industry, we have no a priori reason to believe that there will be any material differences across the USA, or that our findings would change in any material way.

The second potential limitation concerns the matter of admitted versus nonadmitted markets. If it were true that most cyber insurance coverage were written in the nonadmitted markets (i.e. markets that we do not observe), this would reduce the generalizability of our results beyond just the nonadmitted market. In effect, we would only be observing a sample of the overall population of polices. However, based on our preliminary analysis of the coverages and applications, we see no material differences in policies between these markets. That being said, we are unlikely to observe the rate schedules and algorithms for many policies within the nonadmitted market.

## Conclusion

This research has presented the first rigorous thematic analysis of cyber insurance policies filed by insurance companies with state insurance regulators. We collected over 235 policies from New York, Pennsylvania, and California, as well as policies posted publicly on carriers' websites, and separately examined three main components: the coverage, the application questionnaires, and the rate schedules.

Overall, we find that there is a very strong similarity (more similar that expected) across the covered losses, with more variation in exclusions. This suggests that carriers, by and large, are somewhat consistent in identifying cyber perils, and have a certain amount of confidence in their ability to price these risks.

The questionnaires, as part of the required regulatory filings by insurance firms in the admitted market, give interesting insights about what information is (and is not) collected. For example, they request what seems to be an appropriate balance between technical, organizational, and policy/procedure questions. While there is no formal theory by which to gauge the relative balance of questions, a visual inspection of the relative number of questions does not reveal any outlier categories.

Finally, regarding the rate schedules, we found a surprising variation in the sophistication (or lack thereof) of the equations and metrics used to price premiums. Many policies examined used a very simple, flat rate pricing (based a single calculation of expected loss), while others incorporated more parameters such as the firm's asset value (or firm revenue), or standard insurance metrics (e.g. limits, retention, coinsurance), and industry type. More sophisticated policies included information regarding information security controls and practices as collected from the security questionnaires.

In defense of the insurance carriers, however, while the equations may indeed be rudimentary, and based on very subjective inputs, there is no authoritative source for cyber risk assessment. Indeed, proper assessment, and quantification of an organization's security posture is something that the information security industry has been struggling with for decades, and which, to this day, remains elusive.

By examining these components of insurance contracts, we hope to provide additional transparency and insights into this growing market of cyber insurance.
