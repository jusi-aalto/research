## Abstract

This study identifies the effects of security investments that arise from previous failures or external regulatory pressure. Building on organizational learning theory, the study focuses on the healthcare sector where legislation mandates breach disclosure and detailed data on security investments are available. Using a Cox proportional hazard model, we demonstrate that proactive security investments are associated with lower security failure rates. Coupling that result with the economics of breach disclosure, we also show that proactive investments are more cost effective in healthcare security than reactive investments. Our results further indicate that this effect is amplified at the state level, supporting the argument that security investments create positive externalities. We also find that external pressure decreases the effect of proactive investments on security performance. This implies that proactive investments, voluntarily made, have more impact than those involuntarily made. Our findings suggest that security managers and policy makers should pay attention to the strategic and regulatory factors influencing security investment decisions.

## Introduction

With the rapid escalation of information security breaches, organizations in every industry have struggled to learn how to defend themselves against an evolving set of threats. In the healthcare sector, protecting patient data—a rich source of personal information—has long been a concern. Thanks to recent federal funding provided by the [HITECH Act](http://www.healthit.gov/policy-researchers-implementers/hitech-act-0), more and more patient data is moving into electronic medical records (EMR), and consequently healthcare information security has become a growing public concern. Researchers have documented numerous cases in the United States where criminals, seeking to commit medical or financial identity theft, have maliciously exploited patient data (Johnson 2009; Lohmeyer et al. 2002). The resulting public concern has fueled both federal and state legislation mandating breach notification (Roberds and Schreft 2009; Romanosky et al. 2011). Federal regulations such as [HIPAA](http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/) and HITECH, as well as a menagerie of state regulations, now require healthcare providers to follow various notification guidelines to disclose breaches. Such public notifications are costly and result in negative publicity (Kannan et al. 2007; Kolfal et al. 2010; Wang, Rees, and Kannan 2008). Both legislation and breaches have forced organizations to make security investments.

Our study compares the effects of security investments made in reaction to a breach to others made proactively, as well as investigating how external pressure interacts with the investments. We conduct our analysis in the context of the healthcare sector, which—given its strict breach reporting rules—provides a unique context to investigate the impacts of proactive and reactive security investments.

Effective IT investments have long been a topic of active economics research. However, in the security context, some scholars have argued that security investments, unlike other IT investments, depend on political or regulatory decisions as well as economic decisions (Anderson 2001; Bodin et al. 2005; Rowe and Gallaher 2006; Ryan and Ryan 2005). For example, Anderson (2001) argued that neither technical solutions nor economic markets alone could solve security problems. Rather, more holistic approaches are required that combine technical and economic factors with legal and policy factors. Moreover, accurate inputs to an economic analysis are difficult to estimate because success is “nothing happened,” and thus the potential outcomes (benefits or loss) are often intangible—for example, benefits such as regulatory compliance and public credibility or losses such as brand damage. Consequently, most organizations simply react to breaches and end up spending whatever it takes to solve an existing problem or meet regulatory mandates, rather than undertake a sophisticated economic analysis prior to experiencing a failure (Liberti 2008).

Given these economic, political, and regulatory challenges, organizational perspectives nicely complement economic analysis. Organizational researchers have viewed investments in performance improvement as triggers of organizational learning, promoting organizations to acquire the knowledge and skills necessary to achieve their performance goals (Salomon and Martin 2008; Zollo and Winter 2002). This organizational learning perspective has been used to explain the effects of investments in manufacturing quality improvement, because such improvement often includes unobservable organizational changes (e.g., knowledge acquisition) (Dorroh et al. 1994; Fine 1986; Hatch and Mowery 1998; Ittner et al. 2001; Mukherjee et al. 1998; Salomon and Martin 2008).

Similarly, the improvement of security processes also requires knowledge of evolving attackers’ strategies and ever-changing technologies. Thus, with the organizational learning perspective, we can examine the impact of investments on security improvement including unobservable changes in organizational security culture (Culnan et al. 2008; Culnan and Williams 2009). Coupled with an economic perspective, we can evaluate both the learning and the cost effectiveness of security investments.

Further, we examine the public-good nature of information security. In the healthcare sector, organizations often share patient information as patients move between local clinics, small hospitals, tertiary care centers, and long-term rehabilitation centers. Security investments at any point in the healthcare system benefit all players (Appari and Johnson 2009). This makes it possible to study the effects of network externalities stemming from the public good nature of information security. Moreover, HIPAA addresses the interchange of information between organizations by mandating that organizations comply with privacy and security standards. Thus, regulatory pressure is relevant at both the individual organization level and for groups of organizations.

Our study contributes to the literature on information security investments in several ways. First, through an empirical analysis, it provides a deeper understanding of the effects of security investments—both proactive and reactive—on subsequent performance. We demonstrate the different effects of proactive and reactive security investments based on the different types of organizational learning that they facilitate. Second, it identifies the impact of learning from regulatory pressure and the interactions with learning from the different types of security investment. Third, it extends the scope from individual organizations to a regional level (in our case, the state level in the United States). We do so by examining the shared benefit of an individual organization’s investment for all organizations within the same state.

The paper is organized as follows: First, we review relevant theoretical background and then propose our research hypotheses. Next, we describe the research methodology and data collection followed by our results and discussion of the economic effects. Finally, implications and conclusions are presented.

## Theoretical Background

Theoretical analyses on investments fall into two broad categories: organizational and economic. While economic analysis considers investments as the purchase of durable equipment, software, processes, knowledge, etc., in anticipation of favorable future economic returns (Chari et al. 2008; Teisberg 1994; Van Mieghem 1998), organizational analysis considers investments as the quest for improvement in the learning processes for problem-solving heuristics (Carrillo and Gaimon 2000; Ittner et al. 2001; Winter 1994; Zantek et al. 2002).

Security decision makers often rely on qualitative assessments of their security needs (Liang and Xue 2009). Operational researchers have argued that investments in quality improvement are frequently precipitated by failures or external mandates, and the investments result in organizational learning that ultimately yield better quality or performance (Haunschild and Rhee 2004; Ittner et al. 2001; Salomon and Martin 2008). Security researchers also have begun to explore the impact of organizational learning on the relationship between security investment and security performance (Cavusoglu et al. 2008; Herath and Herath 2008; Puhakainen and Siponen 2010).

While prior security literature examined the impact of organizational learning on investment decisions or resource allocation (see Cavusoglu et al. 2008; Smith et al. 2010), our study focuses on antecedent factors (i.e., security failures or external mandates) for security investments and how they and their interaction result in learning that improves security performance. We first categorize security investments as proactive if they occur before any incident and reactive if they occur after an incident (with or without external regulatory pressure). Given that security investments lead to organizational learning through security resource allocation and deployment, the differential effects between proactive and reactive investments likely reside in the difference between their learning effects during the resource allocation and deployment processes. This observation motivated us to investigate whether proactive or reactive security investments perform differently as well as how regulatory pressures affect security performance. Answering these questions will help policy makers and researchers understand the potential impact of new regulation and the value of carrot (investment incentives) versus stick (breach reporting) policies.

We further consider the economic impact of proactive and reactive investments. The security economics literature can be generally segmented into two approaches. One approach, which is based on the cost-effectiveness of investments, tries to answer the question, “How much is saved (or earned) by investing in security?” (Wang, Chaudhury, and Rao 2008). The other approach addresses the question, “How much should be invested?” (Gordon and Loeb 2002). The challenge for either approach is the lack of relevant and applicable data, making it difficult to estimate the monetary costs and benefits of protecting against evolving threats, compromises, and vulnerabilities. Thus, security researchers and practitioners have often used indirect estimation of the financial loss associated with security breaches (HHS 2009; Mulligan and Bamberger 2007) or changes in firm market value resulting from public breach announcements (Cavusoglu et al. 2004; Kannan et al. 2007).

In our case of the healthcare industry, less than 1 percent of healthcare organizations are publicly traded (in the study period, 2005 to 2010), thus estimating the stock market reaction to breaches is not useful. The boards and hospital executives are not focused on maximizing shareholder value. Rather they are focused on their mission related to patients and the community (Appari and Johnson 2009). Of course, they also want to make good technology investments considering the relevant economic trade-offs. Therefore, in our study, we focus on the cost-effectiveness of security decisions by measuring the presence of a collection of security applications and estimating the notification cost of a breach using data on the number of patient records compromised.

## Hypotheses Development

Organizational learning resulting from investments in problem solving, like root cause analysis, enables organizations to discover potential opportunities for shaping a better future (Nonaka 1994). Attewell (1992) argued that investments in advanced technologies are a special category of innovative actions because of the organizational learning burden they impose on employees. Security technologies such as encryption and user authentication impact the workflow processes of employees throughout a healthcare organization. In this environment, where speed and availability of data directly impact patient care, security technologies must be thoughtfully adopted. For example, in our related field research, we have observed cases where poorly implemented authentication technologies were rolled out too quickly, slowing nurse and doctor access to critical patient data—in some cases leading to project failure when the new technology was abandoned. In other cases, where the evaluation and technology rollout process stimulated significant organizational learning, such failures were avoided and significant security performance was achieved.

Although security investments generally provide learning opportunities for all employees through the newly adopted security systems, there have been different views of proactive and reactive investments. Various research has further examined the distinction between proactive and reactive actions (Barth et al. 2010; Ittner et al. 2001; Yue and Cakanyildirim 2007). Commonly, proactive actions are believed to result in different organizational learning occurring from the process of deciding to act (Fine 1986; Li and Rajagopalan 1998), while reactive actions triggered by failures facilitate more remedial learning (Marcellus and Dada 1991). For proactive investments, an organization must make decisions about how and where to invest and deploy security controls. Thus, proactive investments facilitate autonomous learning, which occurs as a by-product of making an investment decision or allocating the investment (Fine 1986; Li and Rajagopalan 1998). Reactive investments give rise to induced learning from failure resolution actions, creating a defense against future failures (Marcellus and Dada 1991).

Consistent with these arguments, the evolving security literature posits that organizational learning influences the link between security investment and security performance. Iheagwara et al. (2004) argue that proactive approaches actively mitigate security risks by examining and analyzing vulnerabilities and threats that might be exploited in the future, while reactive approaches passively carry out postmortem analysis of existing problems. Security practitioners further argue that reactive approaches are not effective in filling the gaps between existing vulnerabilities and future threats because they simply chase existing problems (Kark et al. 2009; Pironti 2005). On the other hand, game-theoretic security researchers argue that reactive policies (quickly learning from past attacks) may be effective enough to discourage rational attackers by focusing efforts on thwarting real attacks and showing agility (Barth et al. 2010; Cavusoglu et al. 2008).

Considering that 22 percent of patient data breaches are related to lost or stolen devices mainly due to negligence (HIMSS 2012), we can expect that both autonomous and failure-induced learning would help healthcare organizations avoid negligence (see Tucker et al. 2007) as well as more serious threats. Thus, despite the mixed theoretical perspectives, we hypothesize that organizational learning from both proactive and reactive investments result in better security performance, implying the following:

**H1a.** Proactive security investments will result in the reduction of subsequent security failures.  
**H1b.** Reactive security investments will result in the reduction of subsequent security failures.

While testing the association between these two types of security investment and performance will help us better understand investment effectiveness, it is also meaningful to examine the difference between the approaches (it can help illuminate the antecedent factor of an investment).

Advocates of reactive strategies argue that as long as an organization focuses on learning from past attacks instead of simply reacting to the attacks, reactive approaches can be competitive with the best proactive approaches. For example, Barth et al. (2010) demonstrated cases where reactive strategies could out-perform proactive ones when defending against previous or similar incidents. Of course, recovering from repeated failures does not lead to customer satisfaction; however, recovery from a few failures through rapid remedial action typically avoids significant dissatisfaction and in some cases can further build customer confidence (Karande et al. 2007). Haunschild and Sullivan (2002) also provide evidence that the learning associated with failure experiences in manufacturing can allow an organization to cope with future failures more efficiently.

On the other hand, advocates of proactive strategies argue that since proactive approaches don’t rely on failure experiences to discover potential critical or weak points, they require developing a deeper understanding of security vantage points (definition and vision), government and public expectations, perceived security concerns, and determinants of security. These requirements of proactive approaches are typically met using a top-down approach (Frakes and Kang 2005). The target domain (i.e., security) is analyzed, and then controls for the domain are defined and implemented considering foreseeable variations. Such proactive strategies coupled with organizational leadership are believed to be effective in remaining ahead of intelligent adversaries (Kark et al. 2009).

However, from an economic perspective, the proactive approach tends to require a large upfront investment—particularly with security because the threat models are constantly evolving, making it difficult to prepare for every possible failure (Rowe and Gallaher 2006). Hence, as Bohme and Moore (2010) found, rather than overinvest proactively, some organizations wait to observe attacks and use this knowledge to better allocate security spending. Bohme and Moore suggest that increasing uncertainty over the weakest links in information security makes it difficult for the organization to know which assets to protect. That uncertainty can lead the organization to decide against security investments until a failure or weak point is realized. Thus in cases with high uncertainty, it may be rational to pursue reactive strategies.

The healthcare industry is generally considered less sophisticated and lags in adoption of the latest information systems and security technologies, as compared to other industries. This observation supports the conclusion that uncertainty over the weakest links in healthcare may be lower than in other industries with a long history of cyber attacks and defense. Lower uncertainty means that healthcare organizations often have not yet addressed known vulnerabilities that represent weak links. Such a situation favors proactive security investment from both a learning-based approach and cost-effectiveness.

Thus, given the low levels of uncertainty about the weakest links (low hanging fruit) across the healthcare sector and the learning benefits of proactive actions, we hypothesize that the effect of proactive investments (and the learning required to understand the uncertainties) should be larger than that of reactive investments.

**H2.** The effectiveness of proactive security investments on the reduction of subsequent security failures is larger than that of reactive security investments.

It is also important to consider the impact of external mandates, such as government requirements, on investment decisions. Testing the effect of external pressure can identify whether organizations learn better in response to internal initiation or external mandates. Prior literature provides conflicting answers to this question.

Some studies found that external pressures are important for organizational learning because external pressures help an organization explore problems and prevent future failures by providing a baseline with which it should comply (March 1991; Naveh and Marcus 2004; Ocasio 1997). Commonly, they have considered government requirements as the activation of attention that can make organizations focus on a problem area. Since government requirements addressing a failure tend to be well-publicized pressures, organizations may be forced to learn more from these pressures—thus overcoming inertia and stimulating organizational change (Ocasio 1997). March (1991) argues that organizations are apt to engage in exploitation of well-known practices, rather than exploration of new ones. This supports the idea that regulatory pressures can stimulate organizational learning and change. Such regulatory pressures promote learning because they cause organizational members to pay more attention to failures, exploit them more deeply, and work to prevent them in the future.

On the other hand, Haunschild and Rhee (2004) demonstrate that involuntary actions induced from external mandates restrict organizational learning (where performance improvement is a key learning outcome) because the voluntary nature of an organizational activity is better accepted by organizational members and result in more permanent change in routines and practices. They further explain that involuntary recalls result in shallower learning processes, and conclude that organizational volition is important to increase commitment and problem analyses, whereas external pressures likely lead to defensive reactions that rarely help the organization.

Likewise, in security, there has been a very active debate concerning the effectiveness of government regulation with security experts on both sides. Some argue that directive security policy is counterproductive because it pushes firms to reach a certain level of controls regardless of idiosyncratic (IT or security) maturity (Bulgurcu et al. 2010; Zhulei et al. 2008). Thus, regulation may waste firm resources and create a compliance mind-set (check the box) rather than a security mind-set.

Over the last decade, breach notification laws have required organizations to notify the information owners of security breaches. In healthcare, breaches often create unusually strong public reactions because of the private nature of medical information. Breach notification laws create significant organizational pressure, both because of the cost of notification and because of negative press coverage (Mulligan and Bamberger 2007). However, some have argued that such public shaming has done little to help affected patients or improve security. Nevertheless, the cost and the attention-getting aspects of breach notifications may help overcome organizational inertia and initiate learning by doing when action is taken.

Given the rapidly changing threats and vulnerabilities, today’s security problems are different than last year’s or even last month’s problems. Under this high uncertainty, external regulatory mandates can only show a basic direction for healthcare organizations to make security investments. Accordingly, such external regulatory pressure is likely to draw organizational attention to security breaches, provide critical security guidelines, and result in new organizational processes aimed at reducing future failures. This leads to the following hypothesis:

**H3.** External pressure will result in the reduction of subsequent security failures.

In addition to the independent effects of external pressure and investments (both proactive and reactive), there are likely to be interaction effects as well: in particular, interaction between the learning effects of external pressure and investments.

First, regulation-induced learning from external mandates can affect autonomous learning from proactive investments. While the regulatory mandates may effectively grant organizations latitude on how to take actions (Majumdar and Marcus 2001), passive focus on these points may cause organizations to ignore the broader understanding of security that is required for a proactive approach. Since the advantage of proactive investments lies in autonomous learning from deciding how and where to invest, the directive nature of regulatory requirements leads organizations to simply focus on the indicated layers rather than assess security at all operational layers (see Radner and Rothschild 1975; Winter 1981). Therefore, proactive investments under external regulatory pressure may not result in the deep learning required to enable the detection and correction of evolving risks.

Also, regulation-induced learning can influence failure-induced learning from reactive investments. Since, in the case of reactive investments, an organization learns about its weak points from failure experiences rather than examining its vulnerabilities and threats, the investments are more likely to focus on improving the weak points revealed by its failure. In this case the attention, forced or directed by external regulatory mandates, can enhance the depth and width of failure-induced learning. Some researchers have argued that reactive investments are generally targeted toward existing problems, and thus the information provided by government requirements might extend the focus of reactive investments or force organizations to address them more deeply (Rowe and Gallaher 2006; Zollo and Winter 2002). However, the mandated changes from security failures and regulatory mandates are unlikely to result in any type of knowledge that penetrates an organization’s daily operations. Thus, the recurrence of similar problems in the future is likely (Bowie and Jamal 2006).

Given the mixed theoretical support (and the low uncertainty about weakest links in healthcare organizations), we do not have a clear basis for the direction of the regulatory impact. Thus in our study, we test how mandated procedures influence proactive and reactive investments and subsequently security performance (without hypothesizing a positive or negative affect). We hypothesize that

**H4a.** External pressure influences the effect of proactive security investments on the reduction of subsequent security failures.  
**H4b.** External pressure influences the effect of reactive security investments on the reduction of subsequent security failures.

## Research Methodology

Figure 1 illustrates our research model and the hypotheses discussed in the previous section. We test our hypotheses using a Cox proportional hazard model and conduct t-tests for cost-effectiveness comparisons.

### The Cox Proportional Hazard Model

Our data on security failures and security investment within healthcare organizations includes breach timing and the adoption timing of security controls. This allows us to employ a statistical method that considers the dependence of the organization’s security survival or failure on the explanatory variables. Hazard functions are particularly useful for such analysis, examining the impact of explanatory variables on the timing or probabilities of failure at an organization level. For example, Eliashberg et al. (1997) employed a proportional hazard model to assess the size of a reserve needed by a manufacturer to meet future warrantee claims. Kauffman et al. (2000) adopted a hazard model to test for a market-wide network effect on network adoption. Li et al. (2010) used a Cox model to relate software firms’ capabilities to their failure rates. These studies analyzed “time to events” and explored the effects of a variety of explanatory variables.

Among hazard models, the Cox model includes other attractive features. The model does not depend on distributional assumptions of survival time, provides flexibility for time dependent explanatory variables, and allows the hazard ratio to be defined as the relative risk based on a comparison of event rates. In particular, information security requires large capital expenditures and significant ongoing maintenance costs, because security features quickly grow obsolete as needs evolve with changing attacker strategies or technologies. Therefore, we employ the Cox model to examine the relative association between the effects of explanatory variables (i.e., security investment and external pressure) and subsequent security failures.

### Research Model

The hazard function, \( h(t) \), refers to the failure rate of a subject per unit of time (\( t \)). The model assumes that the elapsed time to fail, \( T \), is conditional on the explanatory variables. In our study, \( T \) measures the time from investment until either the event of interest—security failure—occurs or the end of the observation period. Thus, our hazard ratio represents the relative risk of security failures within a time unit (where the time unit is one month). The Cox model is expressed as

\[ h_i(t) = h_0(t) e^{\sum_{j=1}^k \beta_j x_j} \]

where \( \beta_j \) is a vector of regression parameters to be estimated for \( j=1, \ldots, K \). The baseline hazard function \( h_0(t) \) corresponds to the case where \( x_j=0 \), involving time but not explanatory variables. The second component is the exponential functions with the sum of \( \beta_j x_j \), which involves explanatory variables but not time at an organization \( i \). The model is referred to as a semi-parametric model since one part of the model involves the unspecified baseline function over time and the other part involves a finite number of regression parameters (Cox 1972). The semi-parametric Cox model is flexible and robust because it does not require assumptions about the baseline distribution.

The hazard ratio, or relative hazard, indicates the expected change in the risk of the terminal event from zero to one when \( x \) changes. If the hazard ratio is one, \( x \) has no effect. If the hazard ratio is greater than one, \( x \) is associated with the increased probability of failure, and vice versa.

\[ \frac{h_i(t)}{h_0(t)} = e^{\sum_{j=1}^k \beta_j x_j} \]

Cox regression coefficients \( \beta_j \) are estimated by partial likelihood (\( L \)), which is determined by the product of individuals’ failure risks at each time (\( t \)). The failure likelihood of each individual is the hazard ratio, \( h_i(t) \), of an individual (\( i \)) divided by the hazard, \( h_i(t) \), of all the other organizations (\( R_i \)) (May et al. 2008).

Most commonly, this examination entails the specification of a linear-like model for the log hazard. The Cox model maximizes the log-likelihood function (\( LL \)) with respect to the parameters of interest, \( \beta_j \)

\[ LL(t) = \sum_{i=1}^N \left( h_i(t) - h_i^c(t) \right) \]
\[ = \sum_{i=1}^N \beta (x_i - x_j^i) = \beta_0 + \beta_0 \hat{x}_N + \ldots \beta_k \hat{x}_H \]

Generalizing the above equation, our Cox model examines the effects of security investment and external regulatory pressure on the time until security failures.

### Self-Selection and Strategic Decisions: Accounting for Endogeneity

It is well known that organizational strategy self-selection complicates the empirical estimation of strategy performance, since an organization’s propensity to make strategic decisions may be endogenously determined (Greene 1981; Susarla and Barua 2011). Failing to account for endogeneity in organizational performance could lead to potentially misspecified and biased results (Greene 2003). In our study, there may be inherent differences between organizations that proactively invested and those that did not. For instance, those organizations that proactively invested might have better resources, IT budget or technological expertise than those that did not.

In order to account for endogeneity, we use a two-step econometric procedure proposed by Heckman (1979). Shaver (1998) extended the Heckman correction and showed that accounting for strategy self-selection changes the interpretation of how entry mode choice affects a firm’s direct investment survival, distinguishing between greenfield entry and entry via acquisition. Following Shaver, we use a probit model to estimate the probability that an organization proactively makes a security investment as a function of resources, IT budget, or technological expertise. Proactive\(_i\) is defined as the difference in the expected performance of proactive and reactive investments.

\[ \text{Proactive}_i^* = \gamma^i w_i + u_i \text{, such that} \]
\[ \text{Proactive}_i^* = 1 \text{ if } \text{Proactive}_i^* > 0, 0 \text{ otherwise} \]

Proactive\(_i\) is the binary variable that indicates whether an investment is proactively made or not. The error term, \( u_i \), is attributable to unobservable characteristics that affect proactive decisions. \( u_i \) captures effects that would be included in the explanatory variables, \( w_i \), but cannot be measured. With respect to proactive decisions, Sinha and Noble (2008) argued that organizations proactively adopt technology when they possess larger IT budgets and better technological expertise. Some measurable factors for \( w_i \) such as IT budget and IT full-time employees are included in the proactive decision model. We rewrite Equation (1) and (2) as follows:

\[ LL(t) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \hat{x}_{1j} + \ldots + \beta_k \hat{x}_{ki} + \delta \text{Proactive}_i + e_i \]

where \( x_i \) includes explanatory variables that affect survival, \( LL(t) \), and \( \varepsilon_i \) is an error term that is normally distributed with zero mean and variance \( \sigma_e \). \( \varepsilon_i \) represents unobservable characteristics that influence survival from failures. If unobservable effects captured in \( \varepsilon_i \) are the same as in \( u_i \) from (2), then \( \varepsilon_i \) and \( u_i \) will be correlated. For example, with respect to investment performance, regardless of whether an investment is proactively made or not, one would expect an organization with better practices, such as security training, or policies to outperform organizations lacking these practices. Therefore, \( \varepsilon_i \) and \( u_i \) will have correlation (\( \rho \)) unless these factors can be measured and included in \( x_i \). Without addressing the potential endogeneity of the investment decision, the hazard model will lead to biased estimates of \( \delta \) (Heckman 1979; Shaver 1998). The treatment model controls for potential endogeneity, nonzero \( \rho \), and the final model can be specified as

\[ LL(t) = \beta_i^* X_i + \delta \text{Proactive}_i + \beta_2 \lambda_i + \zeta \]
\[ \text{Where } \lambda_i = \phi(\gamma^i w_i) / \Phi(\gamma^i w_i) \text{ if } \text{Proactive}_i = 1, \]
\[ \lambda_i = -\phi(\gamma^i w_i) / \{1 - \Phi(\gamma^i w_i)\} \text{ if } \text{Proactive}_i = 1 \]

where, \( \phi \) and \( \Phi \) are the probability density function and cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution, respectively.

## Empirical Analysis

### Data Sources

We employed data from the Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society (HIMSS) Analytics™ Database from 2005 to 2009. The database provides information about the adoption of health information technologies—EMR and security applications—in healthcare organizations. Our focus was data on the adoption of specific security applications such as encryption and user authentication. It also includes various descriptive variables, which we used as control variables such as the size of a healthcare organization, location, academic status, and so on. The data have been widely used in previous studies to examine the impact of healthcare information systems (Angst and Agarwal 2009; Hillestad et al. 2005; Miller and Tucker 2009). For the period 2005-2009, we initially gathered data on 4,487 organizations. Of these, 2,101 were dropped because of missing data, and thus our final sample includes 2,386 organizations. To determine whether our sample is representative of all organizations in the healthcare industry, we compared the sample with all organizations on several measures (bed size, IT equipment, security investment, and revenue) by conducting two-sample t-tests. The t-tests indicated that all p-values are larger than 0.1. Thus, we cannot reject the null hypothesis that the two sample means are the same on each measure and conclude that the healthcare organizations in our study are representative of the healthcare industry.

Next, we matched the sample data with 281 reported healthcare security breaches from January 2005 to June 2010. The trend of all reported breaches is plotted in Figure 2. We employed three sources to obtain information breaches: Health & Human Services (HHS), Identity Theft Resource Center (ITRC), and Data Loss Database.

> **Note:** As required by the HITECH Act, HHS posts a list of breaches of unsecured protected health information affecting 500 or more individuals. See http://www.hhs.gov/.  
> The ITRC breach list is a compilation of data breaches confirmed by various media sources and/or notification lists from state governmental agencies. See http://www.idtheftcenter.org/.

### Variable Definitions

#### Proactive Decision Model

As shown in Equation (2), Proactive is the dependent variable in the proactive decision model...

## Results

Our results support those who argue that attackers’ abilities and resulting threats evolve so quickly that learning from proactive initiatives is particularly important. Hence, the findings, such as reactive and proactive learning on information security, may not be directly generalized to other environments, since the effects of the types of learning may depend on task uncertainty (see Carrillo and Gaimon 2004).

In our economic analysis, we found that the proactive group experiences smaller breaches and lower breach notification costs than the reactive group. This may seem surprising as prior literature argued that a reactive strategy may generally be more cost effective than a proactive one because proactive strategies are likely to overinvest stemming from uncertainty in the weakest links (Rowe and Gallaher 2006). However, considering the observation that healthcare lags many other industries in adoption of the latest security technologies, its uncertainty over where to invest may be substantially lower (healthcare can easily learn from industries with a long history of attacks). Thus by proactively investing in well-known weaknesses, healthcare organizations can enhance the cost effectiveness of their security investments.

We further found that the learning effects vary with the types of internal and external security failures. Organizations have different perceptions in the threats of internal and external security failures, and the threats that are perceived to be more significant tend to enhance the learning effects of security investment with more efforts and resources. Our results show that security investments have more significant effects on external failures than internal failures. This implies that organizations may be more concerned about external threats and thus focus more investments on IT security to curb external threats rather than internal threats. Our finding is consistent with arguments (based on other industries) that firms are often familiar with external sources of attack and tend to focus on handling outsider threats (Crinson 2008; Liu et al. 2009). We note, however, that our investment data was measured by the adoption of security technologies, and that preventing accidental disclosures or malicious data breaches from insiders depends heavily on human factors (that are harder to observe), security training, and policies.

Considering the public-good nature of information security, our results indicate that the effects of both proactive and reactive investments are larger at the state level than at the organization level. This supports the argument that security investments create positive externalities (investments in one organization improve security for everyone). As more patient information is shared between healthcare organizations, positive externalities may increase but could also lead to free rider problems.

External pressure, like government regulation, is also significantly associated with security failures at both the organization and state level. Our results show that when proactive investments were made under external pressure, the learning effect was diminished (0.351 at p<0.05). The finding suggests that proactive investments, voluntarily made, are associated with better performance than those initiated by external pressure. However, although external pressure hurts the effect of proactive investment on security performance, the main effects of proactive investment and external pressure (-0.763 at p<0.01 and -1.250 at p<0.01, respectively) are still larger than the moderating effect (0.351 at p<0.05). This indicates that while external regulatory pressure effectively provides problem-solving guidelines, the regulation-induced learning partially harms the effect of the autonomous learning from proactive decision making or resource allocation. With external regulatory mandates, an organization may passively try to meet the mandates rather than actively conduct its own problem analysis.

On the other hand, external pressure does not significantly influence the effect of reactive investments on security performance. Reactive investment may focus on existing problems, since an organization learns its weak points from failure experiences. Here, the problem-solving guidelines of external regulatory mandates may positively influence the scope of failure-induced learning by incorporating regulation-induced learning including more common or critical failures. This implies that whereas external regulatory requirements significantly hurt autonomous learning of proactive investments, the requirements may help, or at least not hurt, failure-induced learning from reactive investments despite their involuntary nature. This outcome may be the case for reactive strategies where regulation pushes organizations to extend the scope of investment beyond common problem areas (or simply chasing existing problems).

In summary, healthcare organizations have faced two types of task uncertainty over finding their own weak links (internally) and understanding the evolving security threats (externally). Because healthcare organizations have not heavily invested in security, there are relatively low levels of uncertainty over the weak links. However, patient data, as a rich source of personal information, have faced a highly evolving set of security threats. The high uncertainty over the threats has made the effects of autonomous and regulation-induced learning greater than that of failure-induced learning. Likewise, the low uncertainty over weak links has made proactive investments more cost effective than reactive investments. These uncertainties also allow us to draw some implications from the interactions between autonomous, failure-induced and regulation-induced learning. Although government regulations can provide useful security guidelines, we argue that external pressure has partially turned proactive strategies, which can cope with evolving threats as well as potential weak links, into a passive focus or defensive reactions. On the other hand, despite the passive focus by external pressure, reactive strategies focusing on existing weak links may leverage the external security guidelines that can provide useful information on the vulnerabilities not yet addressed in healthcare organizations.

## Implications

Our findings have important implications for both security managers and policy makers. First, security managers and governments should pay considerable attention to decision processes in security investment in order to maximize the effectiveness of the investments. Such effectiveness is particularly important for organizations operating with constrained resources and evolving security threats. Based on these results, we advise chief information security officers to place greater emphasis on proactive initiatives rather than maintaining a purely reactive posture. Second, policy makers should consider regulation that combines proactive initiatives and external pressures—for example, mandating that a portion of the overall IT budget be dedicated to security while allowing the organizations to decide on the types of security investment. Alternatively, financial incentives like those in the HITECH legislation could be earmarked specifically for security. Since the incentives could encourage more organizations to make investments, the organizations can take advantage of the network effects of the investment.

Some important issues remain for future research. We considered only the adoption of security applications without addressing the issue of security policies and training programs. While implementing controls such as training would have a direct learning effect, our study mainly focuses on indirect learning effects through learning by doing or learning by using IT security controls. Future research could also consider longer periods. One limitation of survival models is the fact that it is common to observe organizations that never experience an event within the study period. However, this limitation is of no great consequence because our interest centers on the hazard rates, rather than the survival time. Nonetheless, data covering longer periods would provide more opportunities for interesting analysis.
