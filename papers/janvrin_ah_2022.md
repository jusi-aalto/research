## SYNOPSIS

Due to recent high-profile cybersecurity breaches and increased practitioner and regulatory attention, organizations are under pressure to consider the accounting implications of these attacks and develop appropriate responses. Specifically, cybersecurity events may affect organizations' operations, financial and non-financial performance, and ultimately its stakeholders. To address how cybersecurity issues may affect accounting, this paper presents an Event, Impact, Response Framework to discuss current research and consider implications for both practitioners and researchers. The Framework highlights how practitioners may rely on research findings to better assess cybersecurity threats, understand their impact, and develop response strategies. Results encourage additional research examining how (1) organizations identify cybersecurity threats, incidents, and breaches, (2) cybersecurity affects different risks, and (3) management responses to cybersecurity risks and events. Further, the Framework suggests the need for cybersecurity research to extend beyond the AIS community to areas such as financial accounting, managerial accounting, and auditing.

## I. INTRODUCTION

> Cybersecurity risks pose grave threats to our investors, our capital markets, and our country.  
> —Securities and Exchange Commission (2018)

We present a framework for linking existing cybersecurity research to accounting. This framework provides insights to practitioners and researchers. As noted in the recent Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) statement, organizations face cybersecurity¹ threats constantly in today's environment. According to Kaspersky Lab, there are 360,000 new malicious files a day in 2017 (Kaspersky 2017). In addition to new threats, the cost of cyber-related crimes has increased to about an average of $28 million in 2018 (Accenture 2019). With the increasing number of threats and reported vulnerabilities (RiskBased Security 2017), organizations are challenged to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the data (American Institute of CPAs 2017), to detect the attack (Irwin 2018), and to respond to/recover from data breaches (Deloitte 2016).

These breaches have implications for accountants and auditors as they may result in lower company performance and market value, increased operational risks, lost information, and significant employee time spent ensuring compliance with appropriate privacy and confidentiality regulations (Council of Economic Advisers 2018; Ponemon 2018). We argue that a more systematic framework for linking cybersecurity to accounting is needed.² Accountants are involved in identifying and measuring the costs of cybersecurity events and tracking the impact of these events on the organizations. Financial accountants are tasked with ensuring organizations appropriately disclose cybersecurity events to investors. Auditors often adjust their risk assessment and audit procedures due to the presence of cybersecurity events. The AICPA recognizes this trend by emphasizing cybersecurity coverage in the upcoming CPA evolution (Vien 2021) Given that organizations require accountants from multiple disciplines to examine the responses or consequences of cybersecurity events, this study develops an Event,³ Impact, Response Framework to explore the influence of cybersecurity on accounting and identify key directions for accounting practitioners and researchers.

Our analysis generates several important insights for practitioners and researchers. For practitioners, while cybersecurity events are often difficult to identify and assess, newer technologies such as fuzzy set theory and textual analysis and conceptual frameworks from management information systems and computer science can help organizations better detect potential cybersecurity events. Further, our understanding of the impact of cybersecurity on operational, reputational, compliance, and litigation risks is still quite limited. Joint work between practitioners and researchers may further help us understand and prepare for its impact. Last, studies have provided insights regarding how companies can respond to these events, such as change board or management team composition, disclose cybersecurity risks and breaches, or purchase cybersecurity insurance.

The study also identifies several possible research streams. First, prior research concentrates on responses to publicly identified breaches even though organizations generally spend more resources on addressing threats to prevent incidents and breaches than on responding to these publicly available breaches. Our analysis finds that most existing accounting-related cybersecurity research examines how investors react to either organization-provided or externally provided cybersecurity-related disclosures. More research is needed exploring how organizations detect cybersecurity events and how organizations assess and manage cybersecurity threats.

Second, current accounting-related research investigates the impact of cybersecurity on operational performance and business value. Additional accounting-related work is needed to examine how cybersecurity impacts operational, reputational, compliance, and litigation risks. Third, existing response literature addresses management actions regarding employee training and cybersecurity strategy, investor responses (i.e., market reaction), and auditor responses. Research examining how management reacts to or monitors public perceptions, invests in additional IT infrastructure, and/or purchases cybersecurity insurance, and whether interested parties initiate lawsuits is still very limited.

Finally, the impact of cybersecurity issues extends beyond the information systems community, and we encourage financial accounting, auditing, and managerial accounting researchers to contribute to this important topic by providing a discussion of current theories used in this research. Existing studies published in information systems journals use a wide variety of theories from management, psychology, and criminology, including protection motivation and information diffusion theories. Accounting researchers may bring new thoughts to cybersecurity research by building on different theoretical backgrounds.

This research is important for several reasons. First, cybersecurity risk management is an interdisciplinary area that ranges from strategies to technical solutions. It impacts business operations and may affect all stakeholders of an organization. Accordingly, understanding, assessing, monitoring, and responding to cybersecurity threats and risks has become a critical research topic for accounting researchers. Second, regulators are concerned about organizations' ability to respond to cybersecurity incidents and breaches as noted by the SEC's recent cybersecurity guidance (SEC 2018) and the AICPA's efforts to develop its Cybersecurity Risk Management Reporting Framework (AICPA 2018). Specifically, the SEC states "it is critical that public companies take all required actions to inform investors about material cybersecurity risks and incidents in a timely fashion" (SEC 2018, 4). This Event, Impact, Response Framework assists practitioners and researchers in identifying the actions (or responses) needed. Third, our framework encourages broader research as it expands cybersecurity interest beyond the accounting information systems research community to financial accounting, managerial accounting, and auditing. For example, financial accounting researchers may provide insights regarding cybersecurity disclosures while managerial accounting researchers may examine incentives and monitoring mechanisms for managing cybersecurity threats. Audit researchers may examine how internal and external auditors evaluate clients' cybersecurity risks as they plan and execute their audits.

¹ According to the SEC, cybersecurity can be defined as "[t]he activity or process, ability or capability, or state whereby information and communications systems and the information contained therein are protected from and/or defended against damage, unauthorized use or modification, or exploitation" (SEC 2018, 1).

² We acknowledge that other cybersecurity research review papers exist. Our broad Event, Impact, Response Framework examines the accounting implications of cybersecurity events, their organizational impact, and how various parties respond to these events based upon a review of 153 accounting and information systems articles.

³ We define cybersecurity events broadly by including cybersecurity threats, incidents, and breaches. We acknowledge that cybersecurity threats are persistent whereas incidents and breaches tend to be discrete events.

## II. ORGANIZING FRAMEWORK

Given our objective is to examine how cybersecurity impacts accounting, our framework concentrates on cybersecurity events, how these events impact organizations, and responses by various parties to these events. We borrow ideas from both the COSO Enterprise Risk Management Framework (COSO 2017) and Blankespoor (2018)'s Framework of Firm Financial Communication and Investor Response, to develop an Event, Impact, Response Framework to organize existing research and provide insights to accounting practitioners and researchers. For example, the COSO Enterprise Risk Management Framework notes that organizations need to identify the impact of threats, in this case cybersecurity threats, and to follow up by developing responses to the related risks⁴ (COSO 2017).

Further, the Framework of Firm Financial Communication and Investor Response (Blankespoor 2018) examines how various parties, including management, may respond to cybersecurity breaches.⁵ It suggests that before disclosing cybersecurity breach information, an organization must determine the composition of the information package: (a) what, (b) how, and (c) who. For example, the organization selects what information to be disclosed. The information may be required by legislation or mandatorily provided. Information provided may range from more objective and verifiable, such as the number of accounts impacted, to more subjective and less verifiable, such as impact of breach on future product sales. Next, management determines how information will be structured in the disclosure by identifying the communication medium to be used (i.e., text, audio, or video) and the presentation attributes (i.e., affect or tone, readability, formality of language, vividness or intensity, ordering of the information, and emphasis or focus on each data item). Finally, management determines who will present the information. The framework is shown in Figure 1.

### Cybersecurity-Related Events

Our Event, Impact, Response Framework begins with cybersecurity-related events including threats, incidents, and breaches. We recognize that all organizations are under constant cybersecurity threats as shown in the two-sided arrow in the bottom of Figure 1 (Wall Street Journal 2018). As discussed below, once management acknowledges cybersecurity threats exist, they may respond by developing a risk assessment plan. If a threat agent exploits vulnerability, it becomes an incident or breach. Cybersecurity incidents and breaches⁶ can occur at any time. Importantly, cybersecurity incidents and breaches must be detected before organizations can examine their impact and how various interested parties can respond. Further, incidents and breaches may not be disclosed immediately upon detection due to time needed for organizations to identify their impact.

### Impact of Cybersecurity on Organizations

Cybersecurity incidents and breaches may have a significant effect on an organization (Goel and Shawky 2009). For example, breaches can result in lower performance, either operationally by reducing net income or impacting business value resulting in lower market value. In addition, cybersecurity incidents and breaches may affect operational factors such as service disruptions and loss of intellectual property (Deloitte 2019). Cybersecurity incidents and breaches can negatively impact the organization's reputation and result in devaluation of trade names and/or lost customers (Deloitte 2019; Wang, Ulmer, and Kannan 2013b). Cybersecurity incidents and breaches may also result in compliance challenges and/or attorney fees and litigation costs (Deloitte 2019; Demek, Raschke, Janvrin, and Dilla 2018; Lenk, Krahel, Janvrin, and Considine 2019).

### Responses to Detected Cybersecurity Threats, Incidents, and Breaches

Different parties respond to detected cybersecurity incidents and breaches in different ways. The Event, Impact, Response Framework examines how four specific parties—management, investors, auditors, and regulators—respond to detected incidents and breaches.⁷

#### Management Response

Management generally determines whether to disclose the breach. Management may also respond to cybersecurity challenges by compensating victims. How management reacts to the detected cybersecurity breach may impact external stakeholders' perceptions of the organization (Drinkwater 2016). Further, management may modify their risk assessment/management process.

---

⁴ We define a threat as a circumstance with the potential to adversely impact organizational operations (NIST Cybersecurity Risk Assessment Framework [800-53 Rev. 5] 2020). In contrast, a risk is a measure of the extent to which an entity is threatened by a potential circumstance or event (NIST Cybersecurity Risk Assessment Framework [800-53 Rev. 5] 2020).

⁵ We acknowledge that how investors, auditors, and regulators respond may be influenced by management response. For example, if management fails to properly disclosure a cybersecurity breach, investors may discount the organization's value, auditors may adjust their risk assessment, and regulators may respond with penalties. Further discussion of how the responses of investors, auditors, and regulators may be influenced by management response is beyond the score of this framework.

⁶ Though the terms cybersecurity incident and cybersecurity breach are often used interchangeably, we distinguish these terms based on legal requirements. Cybersecurity incidents refer to occurrences that actually or potentially result in adverse consequences to an information system (SEC 2018, 2), whereas incidents become breaches when resulting state or national laws are broken (e.g., Ballon 2019; Cichonski, Millar, Grance, and Scarfone 2012). Cybersecurity breaches must be disclosed to appropriate external parties due to compliance requirements (e.g., CA Civ Code § 1798.29 2017; Federal Trade Commission 2019). Thus, financial accountants are often involved in estimating the costs of cybersecurity breaches. Further, most research using publicly available data examines cybersecurity breaches that are reported by news media. However, separating breaches from incidents is needed when investigating compliance and litigation issues.

⁷ As noted by a reviewer, disclosure of cybersecurity events may cause customers to leave the organization. We implicitly acknowledge this by noting that in the previous section that cybersecurity events may impact operational and business value. Further discussion of customer responses is beyond the scope of this framework.

```

Many cybersecurity challenges, particularly incidents and breaches, involve inappropriate action by employees (Bartolik 2018; Talbott 2018). Thus, management may respond to these challenges by increasing employee security training. In addition, management may change security strategy, policies, and procedures, including developing a cybersecurity risk management program as suggested by the AICPA (2017). To reduce threat of reoccurrence, management may make additional investments in IT security and/purchase cybersecurity insurance (Hudson and Brunsman 2017). Finally, management may take proactive steps that involve increasing the cybersecurity expertise on the leadership team, reducing the compensation of the CEO, CFO, and/or CIO, or removing these individuals from their responsibilities.

#### Investor Response

Investors may adjust their investment decisions. For example, investors may react to detected cybersecurity breaches by lowering the probability of investment or offering less money to purchase stock. In contrast, market participants may view publicly disclosed cybersecurity breaches in a positive light as they respect the fact that the organization's management is willing to make this voluntary disclosure. Finally, investors may respond to cybersecurity breaches that are not appropriately or timely disclosed by initiating lawsuits.

#### Auditor Response

When cybersecurity threats are acknowledged, external and/or internal auditors may work with management as consultants to address these concerns. Further, when cybersecurity incidents and breaches are detected, both internal and external auditors may respond by increasing their efforts. External auditors may charge higher fees and/or perform additional engagements such as reviewing specific cybersecurity controls or engaging in a cybersecurity risk management examination (AICPA 2018). Finally, auditors may sue an organization if they suspect that its management knew of critical cybersecurity information but purposely did not disclose this information to the auditors.

#### Regulator Response

Regulators may respond to cybersecurity events acknowledged by encouraging the organization to disclose its cybersecurity risk assessment activities (AICPA 2018). Further, regulators may respond to detected breaches by imposing fines or additional reporting requirements. Finally, similar to investors, regulators may sue the organization to recover the costs incurred due to cybersecurity breaches.

## III. METHODOLOGY

To understand, summarize, and analyze the extent of studies in cybersecurity that relate to accounting, we searched for literature examining how cybersecurity events (including threats, incidents, and breaches) occurred, how organizations identified such events, how these events impact organizations, and how management, auditors, investors, and regulators responded to event disclosures. Specifically, we used a list of keywords to search the websites of the following leading accounting, accounting information systems, and management information systems journals from 2003 to 2019: Accounting Horizons, Accounting, Organizations and Society, The Accounting Review, Auditing: A Journal of Practice & Theory, Contemporary Accounting Research, European Journal of Information Systems, Information & Management, Information Systems Journal, Information Systems Research, International Journal of Accounting Information Systems, Journal of Accounting and Public Policy, Journal of Accounting Research, Journal of Computer Security, Journal of Emerging Technologies in Accounting, Journal of Information Systems, Journal of Information Technology, Journal of Management Information Systems, Journal of the Association for Information Systems, Journal of Strategic Information Systems, MIS Quarterly, Review of Accounting Studies. These keywords were "(cyber)security," or "information security," "security investment," "security incident/breach," "(cyber)security risk/threat," "security compliance," and "(cyber)security disclosure." This process resulted in a total of 153 articles as shown in Panel A of Table 1.

For each study, the authors independently reviewed the article to identify the theory (or theories) and methodology used and classify it according to our Event, Impact, Response Framework.⁸ We grouped the articles into three major groups: studies focusing on threats, incidents, and breaches (Table 2), studies about organizational impacts (Table 3), and management, investor, auditor, and regulator characteristics and responses (Table 4).⁹

---

⁸ Discrepancies between the authors were resolved following additional review by both authors. In some cases, papers relied on prior literature instead of a specific theory (or theories). In these cases, we label the theory as "Prior literature."

⁹ In Tables 2 to 4, we identify the research theory used, methodology, and main findings. The studies are presented in chronological order.

In general, cybersecurity studies were built on theories from several fields including economics, accounting, finance, psychology, criminology, and computer science. Theory categorization notes that for the 35 studies examining cybersecurity threats, incidents, and breaches, a wide variety of theories were used as shown in Panel B of Table 1. Specifically, four studies replied on prior literature. Two studies each were based on innovation diffusion (Rogers 1962), protection motivation (Rogers 1975), and economics of information security theories. Diffusion theory describes the process by which an innovation is communicated through certain channels over time among the members of a social system (Rogers 1962, 6). In the context of information security, diffusion theory may describe how new security practices and standards are developed and communicated. Protection motivation theory, on the other hand, describes how individuals are motivated to react to perceived threats in a self-protective way (Rogers 1975). Within information security, protection motivation theory may explain how individuals react to security issues. Studies focusing on cybersecurity impact generally used valuation theory concepts¹⁰ to explain why and how security events may affect business value. Finally, regarding responses to cybersecurity events, in addition to the protection motivation theory and prior literature, many studies focused on voluntary disclosure theory to investigate how organizations respond to security events.

As noted in Panel B of Table 1, a wide variety of methodologies were used in studies examining cybersecurity-related events. Modeling, framework, or design science type studies were more commonly used on studies focusing on threats and events. Most studies examining organizational impact of cybersecurity have concentrated on operational performance, so were mostly archival. Several different methodologies, such as survey, archival, and modeling, were used for studies examining responses to cybersecurity events.

Finally, we note that existing cybersecurity studies are mainly from the information systems community. This research gap is puzzling given the skills and knowledge that accounting researchers possess. For example, archival researchers examine auditor reactions to other significant client events. This highlights how accounting researchers can contribute to this literature by extending the theories or by adding new theoretical perspectives.

¹⁰ Valuation theory is the process of determining the fair value of an asset or a firm.

## IV. REVIEW OF EXISTING ACADEMIC RESEARCH

We now summarize prior studies based on our Event, Impact, Response Framework to develop implications for practitioners and academics.

### Cybersecurity-Related Events

#### Cybersecurity Threats

As noted earlier, the threat of cybersecurity breaches occurs daily in most organizations. Cybersecurity threats have evolved from threats of customers' sensitive personal information to broader, more strategic threats such as ransomware, theft of intellectual property, and compromising critical infrastructure (B. Apostolou, N. Apostolou, and Schaupp 2018). These threats have caused many organizations to shift from a strategy based on preventive controls to a more focused strategy addressing specific risks while acknowledging the almost certain inevitability of cybersecurity breaches (Apostolou et al. 2018).

Though understanding threats is critical when assessing cybersecurity risks according to professional standards and guidance (NIST 800-53 Rev. 5 2017; NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1 2012; Schmittling and Munns 2010), research to date in this area focuses more on the prevention or detection of potential threats (e.g., V. Mookerjee, R. Mookerjee, Bensoussan, and Yue 2011). For example, Abu-Musa (2006) shows that accidental entry of bad data by employees, accidental destruction of data by employees, the introduction of computer viruses, natural and human-made disasters, sharing passwords, and misdistribution of information are the major perceived threats by the Egyptian banking industry. Yeh and Chang (2007) and Ransbotham and Mitra (2009) use innovation diffusion and criminology theories to discuss different threats and paths of compromises conceptually. From the prevention and detection point of view, Straub and Welke (1998) suggest an information security risk planning model with information security awareness education and countermeasure matrix while Sun, Srivastava, and Mock (2006) propose a conceptual methodology to perform the risk assessment with an illustrative example. In contrast, Heikka, Baskerville, and Siponen (2006) build on design theory to propose a design framework for secure information systems.

Further, Wang, Gupta, and Rao (2015) focus specifically on the management of insider threats for financial institutions from the perspective of artificial immune systems by using user access data. They show how accessibility can cause applications to be exposed to insider threats. Wall, Lowry, and Barlow (2016) propose a theoretical model to explain how firm characteristics may affect the likelihood of regulatory rule violations. Finally, many studies emphasize specific types of threat or vulnerabilities (e.g., Bugliesi, Calzavara, Focardi, and Khan 2015; Chen, Kataria, and Krishnan 2011; Foley and Fitzgerald 2011; Phatak et al. 2013; Ransbotham, Mitra, and Ramsey 2012; Rubio, Roman, Alcaraz, and Zhang 2019; Wong, Ray, Stephens, and Lewis 2012; Zahedi, Abbasi, and Chen 2015) such as intrusion detection systems (e.g., Blyth and Thomas 2006; Cavusoglu, Mishra, and Raghunathan 2005; H. Cavusoglu, Raghunathan, and H. Cavusoglu 2009; Jajodia, Park, Serra, and Subrahmanian 2016; Yue and Çakanyildirim 2007), authentication or password design (e.g., Calderon, Chandra, and Cheh 2006; Keith, Shao, and Steinbart 2009; Mannan and van Oorschot 2011), malware (e.g., Rieck et al. 2011), mobile devices (e.g., Tu, Turel, Yuan, and Archer 2015), and phishing (e.g., Bergholz et al. 2010). For instance, Rubio et al. (2019) propose a technical solution to track advanced persistent threats (APTs),¹¹ given their impact on critical infrastructures.

Other studies emphasize countermeasures or controls (e.g., Baskerville, Spagnoletti, and Kim 2014; Cremonini and Nizovtsev 2010; Kumar, Park, and Subramaniam 2008; Otero 2015; Rahimian, Bajaj, and Bradley 2016; Shin, Lee, and Kim 2018; Vuorinen and Tetri 2012). For example, both Otero (2015) and Rahimian, Bajaj, and Bradley (2016) suggest different ways to better select the appropriate control mechanisms when facing information security threats. Otero (2015) uses fuzzy logic theory¹² to more accurately assess existing weaknesses identified in prior literature for financial systems. In contrast, Rahimian, Bajaj, and Bradley (2016) develop a model suggesting using in-place security controls and missing controls to score the protection levels needed, which can be used to compare against unauthorized access and data modifications.

#### Cybersecurity Incidents and Breaches

How researchers identify cybersecurity incidents and breaches has changed over time. Earlier studies identified "breach samples" by conducting key word searches from news articles instead of breached organizations' announcements, given that breach laws and regulations were not enacted until 2003.¹³ Further, before breach laws and regulations, organizations may not have had strong incentives to disclose these early events to the public (Bao, Kim, Mian, and Su 2019; Kothari, Shu, and Wysocki 2009). For later studies, the data sources included both news articles and information from databases such as DataLossDB, Privacy Rights Clearing House, and Audit Analytics Cybersecurity database. These studies do not separate cybersecurity incidents from breaches, nor were they designed to address issues related to data breach laws and regulations.

Information about cybersecurity breaches is more likely to be available due to the regulatory requirements. For instance, Florida's and Colorado's breach laws require notifications be sent to affected individuals within 30 days.¹⁴ These events are by definition more likely to result in the loss of reputation, compliance issues, and lawsuits. Prior studies (e.g., Wang, Kannan, and Ulmer 2013a) consider information security events as observable consequences of information security risk management programs or the realization of information security risks.

In summary, prior research focuses more on the prevention or detection of potential cybersecurity events rather than risk assessment. This may be due to the ease of accessing publicly available cybersecurity breach information over privately maintained risk assessment data. Further, these studies generally do not examine how organizations identify threats despite evidence that organizations spend significant resources preventing breaches and complying with regulations. Most prevention and detection of potential cybersecurity event research is done by information systems researchers. We encourage accounting researchers to fill this research gap given their knowledge of the risk assessment process.

¹¹ According to Kaspersky, the security solution provider, "an advanced persistent attack (APT) uses continuous, clandestine, and sophisticated hacking techniques to gain access to a system and remain inside for a prolonged period of time, with potentially destructive consequences." See https://www.kaspersky.com/resource-center/definitions/advanced-persistent-threats for more information.

¹² Unlike Boolean logic, which allows only true or false outcomes, fuzzy logic theory accounts for probability that each specific outcome is achieved.

¹³ The earliest breach notification law was enacted in 2003 in California.

### Impact of Cybersecurity on Organizations

Cyber security risk varies by industry and can be idiosyncratic for organizations. For example, since the energy industry fuels day-to-day lives, cybersecurity protection is critical (Apostolou et al. 2018). Cybersecurity breaches can directly impact organizations by lowering net income and/or market value. Further, building on the rational expectation model,¹⁵ Wang et al. (2013b) argue that after a security breach, a company's risk profile changes. Its future cash flows also change due to the immediate noncompliance costs, potential loss in reputation, litigation costs, and the impact on operations (Gordon, Loeb, and Zhou 2011; Hua and Bapna 2013). Some research found negative effects (Campbell, Gordon, Loeb, and Zhou 2003; Ettredge and Richardson 2003; Goel and Shawky 2009; Gordon et al. 2011; Hinz, Nofer, Schiereck, and Trillig 2015) while others found very limited evidence (e.g., Richardson, Smith, and Watson 2019). Further, cybersecurity breaches may result in reputation costs, i.e., economic harm that occurs as a result of damage to organizations' standing, trust, or character with its investors, customers, and even employees. Reputation costs have been discussed in practitioner articles (Accenture 2016; Bouveret 2018; Schlarman 2017) though it is still unclear from prior studies how cybersecurity breaches may impact these costs. For both practitioners and researchers, how cybersecurity events impact an organization's reputation is still an open question.

Litigation issues, different from the reputation costs, have been discussed in accounting literature from different viewpoints. For example, Field, Lowry, and Shu (2005) use a simultaneous equations model to show disclosures may deter certain types of litigation while Rogers, Buskirk, and Zechman (2011) find that plaintiffs target more optimistic statements and that sued companies are more likely to have unusually optimistic earnings announcements relative to other firms experiencing similar economic circumstances. Though we do not observe studies regarding compliance nor litigation issues after cybersecurity breaches, compliance and litigation are major concerns faced by breached organizations. Practitioners have discussed the importance of compliance in the cybersecurity context due to its critical role and potential cost of noncompliance (Campagna 2019; DiPietro 2018; Jain 2019). Further, lawsuits are becoming more common for cybersecurity breaches, and we started to see settlements with breached companies to compensate affected users/customers. For example, Yahoo!, in January of 2019, agreed to pay $29 million to settle a series of attacks from 2013 to 2016 (Newman 2019) and Equifax has class-action lawsuits in all 50 states, including more than 240 individual class-action lawsuits and more than 60 government investigations (Swaminatha 2017).

In summary, prior literature examines the impact of cybersecurity events on organizations concentrates on shorter term operational performance. This may be due to lack of availability of longer-term operational performance data or the lack of clear relationship between cybersecurity events and long-term effects. In contrast, more research is needed to investigate the impact of cybersecurity events on organizations' reputational, compliance, and litigation risks, areas where publicly available data are harder to find. In addition, separating breaches from incidents will allow researchers to better investigate the implications of compliance and litigation risks. For practitioners, in addition to the reputation cost impact mentioned earlier, organizations can focus more on how the compliance and litigation risks may affect the security measures.

### Responses to Detected Cybersecurity Threats, Incidents, and Breaches

#### Management Response

When cybersecurity threats are identified or cybersecurity incidents and breaches occur, management has several ways to respond. As discussed in the Event, Impact, Response Framework, management must determine whether to disclose the incident and/or breach and in what format (Gordon, Loeb, Lucyshyn, and Sohail 2006). Specifically, regarding cyber-attacks, Amir, Levi, and Livne (2018) show that the breached company's business value declines 3.6 percent when the cyber-attack information is withheld.

With or without information security breaches, prior studies have built on voluntary disclosure theory and focused on the risk factors disclosed by companies in their 10-K filings (Gordon, Loeb, and Sohail 2010; Li, No, and Wang 2018b; Wang et al. 2013a). These studies find that (1) the market values the disclosing of information security-related risk factors, and (2) these disclosed risk factors can be used to predict future information security breaches. Differently, Ettredge, Guo, and Li (2018) focus on the trade secrets disclosed in 10-K filings and suggest that such disclosure may attract data breach activities. Berkman, Jona, Lee, and Soderstrom (2018) develop a continuous measure for cyber awareness by using textual analysis involving all cyber disclosures of firms' 10-Ks and show that the market positively values cybersecurity awareness. For practitioners, compliance issues and challenges exist (Wang, Yen, and Yoon 2022). For example, Rosati, Gogolin, and Lynn (2019), though focusing on cybersecurity events and audit fees, pointed out the increase in audit fees for firms that receive cybersecurity-related comment letters. Recently, we have observed SEC comment letters asking organizations to provide more information about specific cybersecurity disclosures, consistent with the concerns raised in prior studies (Li et al. 2018b; Wang et al. 2013a). To summarize, organizations currently struggle to identify the appropriate level of cybersecurity disclosure that meets SEC guidance but does not expose more potential risks to organizations.

Two recent experimental studies focus on investors' responses to the Cybersecurity Risk Management Reporting Framework, adopted by AICPA, versus existing risk factor disclosures. Frank, Grenier, and Pyzoha (2019) find that issuing management's report without assurance is more effective for nonprofessional investors when an organization has not disclosed any cyberattack. From a different perspective, a recent working paper, Cheng and Wang (2019), provides evidence and policy implications by examining nonprofessional investors' decisions given different types of cybersecurity disclosures (i.e., proposed cybersecurity risk management reports versus existing cybersecurity risk factor disclosures) before and after cybersecurity breach incidents. Cheng and Wang (2019)'s results suggest that nonprofessional investors are less likely to invest in breached firms with the disclosure of cybersecurity risk management reports alone. Further, disclosing the risk management report with an independent assurance report does not result in the mitigation of the negative impact of security breach news.

Major breaches often require management to compensate victims and engage in public perception management. When responding to cybersecurity breaches, Goode, Hoehle, Venkatesh, and Brown (2017) discuss the Sony PlayStation case from the perspective of service failure and expectation confirmation theory. They find that when customers' compensation expectations are met, compensation is an effective way to affect their service quality perceptions. However, not meeting customers' compensations' expectations results in lower re-purchase intentions. Other than compensating customers, managers must consider how the general public will view their responses (Gwebu, J. Wang, and L. Wang 2018). Though public perception management has been identified to be an important strategy in different contexts (e.g., Benthaus, Risius, and Beck 2016), our understanding of how organizations engage with the general public following cybersecurity breaches is very limited.

Further, the Event, Impact, and Response Framework notes that managers may respond to cybersecurity breaches by taking preventive steps such as the assessing risks, increasing user training, and/or making changes to strategies, policies, or procedures that affect user behaviors.

Several studies discuss the assessment of information security risks (e.g., Dhillon and Torkzadeh 2006; Hu, Hart, and Cooke 2007; Siponen and Iivari 2006). Other studies discuss a wide range of topics about strategies (e.g., Nazareth and Choi 2015), policies, and procedures (e.g., E. Niemimaa and M. Niemimaa 2017), such as outsourcing (Lee, Geng, and Raghunathan 2013), assurance (Spears, Barki, and Barton 2013), security certification (Hsu 2009), improvisation (Njenga and Brown 2012), and perception differences between insiders and professionals (Posey, Roberts, Lowry, and Hightower 2014). Three papers (Katos and Adams 2005; Goel and Chengalur-Smith 2010; Stahl, Doherty, and Shaw 2012) focus solely on the information security policies. For example, Goel and Chengalur-Smith (2010) identify three dimensions, namely, breadth, clarity, and brevity that can be used to show how well an information security policy is written. They find a negative relationship between clarity and brevity, illustrating the challenges practitioners encourage when balancing providing enough explanation versus being verbose. To summarize, this research suggests that assessing information security risks, cybersecurity strategy, and information security policies are important ways that managers can respond to cybersecurity breaches.

Another stream of literature emphasizes user training or capability building (e.g., Jalali, Siegel, and Madnick 2019; Karjalainen and Siponen 2011) or user behaviors (e.g., Boss, Galletta, Lowry, Moody, and Polak 2015; S. R. Boss, Kirsch, Angermeier, Shingler, and R. W. Boss 2009; Willison and Warkentin 2013). Several MIS studies focus on information security awareness (e.g., D'Arcy, Hovav, and Galletta 2009; D'Aubeterre, Singh, and Iyer 2008; Dinev and Hu 2007; Herath et al. 2014; Rubio et al. 2019; Tsohou, Karyda, Kokolakis, and Kiountouzis 2015; Vaast 2007). For instance, Dinev and Hu (2007) build on the theory of planned behavior¹⁶ to show that cybersecurity awareness is a predictor of user behavioral intention to use protective technologies. Further, Herath et al. (2014) demonstrate that users' perception of risks and the evaluation of different security management strategies can affect users' attention to adopt an email security service. Other studies have focused on various behavioral issues, such as the factors that may increase one's susceptibility to phishing emails (Goel and Chengalur-Smith 2010; Wright and Marett 2010), taking necessary precautions or motivation to secure assets or deter/explain insecure behavior (e.g., Anderson and Agarwal 2010; Dang-Pham, Pittayachawan, and Bruno 2017; Johnston, Gangi, Howard, and Worrell 2019; Li et al. 2018a; Lowry and Moody 2015; Raddatz, Coyne, and Trinkle 2019; Vance, Anderson, Kirwan, and Eargle 2014; Warkentin, Walden, Johnston, and Straub 2016; Willison, Warkentin, and Johnston 2018), and user participation in information security management (Spears and Barki 2010). Overall, for practitioners, studies beyond accounting provide several solutions that organizations may leverage to affect user behaviors to reduce cybersecurity risks and follow security policies and procedures.

Further, Curry, Marshall, Crossler, and Correia (2018) and Curry, Marshall, Correia, and Crossler (2019) propose an InfoSec Action Process Model¹⁷ to examine employee security training or influence employee behavior while Menard, Bott, and Crossler (2017) and Posey, Roberts, Lowry, Bennett, and Courtney (2013) focus on users' motivation in protecting information security. Based on protection motivation theory, Crossler, Long, Loraas, and Trinkle (2014) find that employees motivated by self-efficacy and response efficacy were more likely to comply with bring your own device (BYOD) policies. Lee, Warkentin, Crossler, and Otondo (2017) further suggest monitoring mechanisms for bring your own device policies. Differently, using an experiment, Tan and Yu (2018) suggest that higher responsibility acceptance is an effective strategy with an external breach.

Additional studies examine information security policy compliance issues (e.g., Barlow, Warkentin, Ormond, and Dennis 2018; Bélanger, Collignon, Enget, and Negangard 2017; X. Chen, Wu, L. Chen, and Teng 2018; D'Arcy and Teh 2019; Goel and Chengalur-Smith 2010; Guo and Yuan 2012; Guo, Yuan, Archer, and Connelly 2011; Ifinedo 2014; Johnston and Warkentin 2010; Johnston, Warkentin, McBride, and Carter 2016; Kolkowska, Karlsson, and Hedström 2017; Li, Sarathy, Zhang, and Luo 2014; Lowry and Moody 2015; Lowry, Posey, Bennett, and Roberts 2015; Myyry, Siponen, Pahnila, Vartiainen, and Vance 2009; Puhakainen and Siponen 2010; Siponen, Mahmood, and Pahnil 2014; Siponen and Vance 2010). For instance, Moody, Siponen, and Pahnila (2018) review 11 different public health, criminology, and psychology theories and develop a unified theory to understand compliance issues in the context of information security policies while Cram et al. (2019) perform a meta-analysis and suggest more theory-building efforts be given to information security policy compliance.

Malimage, Raddatz, Trinkle, Crossler, and Baaske (2019) measure inertia (i.e., a person's persistence to use an existing system and reluctance to use a new system) through survey results using three categories: affective-based, behavioral-based, and cognitive-based inertia. From a different angle, Xu, Guo, Haislip, and Pinsker (2019) demonstrate that breached companies may engage in earnings management activities.

Further, managers may invest in additional software and information security management systems following cybersecurity breaches. Prior related research focuses on information security investments (Gordon, Loeb, Lucyshyn, and Zhou 2015; Hausken 2006, 2007; Tanaka, Matsuura, and Sudoh 2005). For example, Gordon and Loeb (2002), using analytical modeling, show that for a given potential loss, an organization should not focus its investments on the most vulnerable information since this information is too costly to protect. Recently, Angst, Block, D'Arcy, and Kelley (2017) demonstrate that different types of information technology adopters (i.e., symbolic versus substantive) have different impact on the negative association between IT security investments and data breaches.

A growing number of organizations respond to cybersecurity challenges by purchasing cybersecurity insurance (Apostolou et al. 2018; Werner 2017). Despite its importance, our understanding of the insurance contracts and how organizations select insurance policies versus other risk-mitigating activities is still very limited. Prior studies only provide general guidance on insurance strategy and possible effects. For example, Seog (2006) uses an analytical modeling approach to show that insurance may make organizations more aggressive as the cost of risks is limited. In the context of cybersecurity, this finding raises the question of whether having cybersecurity insurance will result in organizations paying less attention to potential cybersecurity issues. In contrast, Bodin, Gordon, Loeb, and Wang (2018) provide more specific insurance strategy guidance by modeling how organizations can select between cybersecurity coverage and non-coverage areas.

Last, organizations may respond to cybersecurity breaches by increasing cybersecurity expertise on the leadership team (Higgs, Pinsker, Smith, and Young 2016; Vincent, Higgs, and Pinsker 2019) or even change the leadership team after breaches (Banker and Feng 2019). However, instead of focusing on management responses, several studies investigate how top management team or board characteristics may affect the occurrence of cybersecurity breaches. For instance, Feng and Wang (2019) demonstrate that CIO risk appetite and the power structure is associated with cybersecurity breaches. From a different angle, Kwon, Ulmer, and Wang (2013), Hsu and Wang (2014), and Hsu and Wang (2021) build on prior literature in security governance and focus on top management team or board characteristics, such as the position, compensation, age, tenure, and busyness. These studies provide evidence of how those characteristics may be related to information security breaches. For practitioners, these studies suggest that the background, demographics, or expertise of top management team or board members may impact organizations' cybersecurity risks. For example, given the idiosyncratic nature of cybersecurity risks, when the directors have more board seats, an individual director's attention to different risks and security practices may be reduced, which may impact the effectiveness of security governance. Further, when board members have more diversified organizational and industry experiences, team decision processes and ultimately, the effectiveness of security policies may be affected.

¹⁶ The theory of planned behavior (Ajzen 1991) conjectures that attitude toward the behavior, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control influence behavioral intention.

¹⁷ The InfoSec Action Process Model (Curry et al. 2018) transforms intention into initiating action in compliance with security recommendations.

#### Investor Response

Investors may respond to cybersecurity breaches by reducing their investment in the breached company. Given that cybersecurity incidents or breaches may affect an organization's risk profile and/or future cash flows, the value of the affected company may be lowered, which in turn result in lower stock price based on the valuation theory. This stream of literature can be traced back to almost 20 years. For example, Campbell et al. (2003) investigate the market reactions to a list of information security incidents from 1995 to 2000 but do not find consistently negative market responses. Hovav and D'Arcy (2003) focus on 23 denial-of-service attacks from 1998 to 2002 and find that the market responds negatively to internet companies. Similarly, Goel and Shawky (2009), Gordon et al. (2011), and Hinz et al. (2015) also find that the market responds negatively to information security breaches. Given the inconsistent findings regarding how the capital market reacts to information security incidents, Kannan, Rees, and Sridhar (2007) turn their attention to long-term market reactions but do not observe negative market responses based on different subsamples. Wang et al. (2013b) suggest that the inconsistent findings in prior studies may be explained by the information provided through the breach news articles. Recent research, such as Kvochko and Pant (2015) and Richardson et al. (2019), again note that a clear negative impact on business value after cybersecurity incidents may not exist. Using an experiment approach, Cheng and Walton (2019) show that nonprofessional investors' reactions are lower if the disclosure comes from an external source. Further, these investors provide their least favorable judgments when the breached company initiates the disclosure and significant time occurs between the data breach and initial public disclosure.

In addition to the breached organization, studies examine whether a spillover effect exists. Ettredge and Richardson (2003) show that internet companies in the same industry as the breached companies also experienced negative market reactions. Cavusoglu, Mishra, and Raghunathan (2004), differently, demonstrate that the information security developers benefit from breaches. Similarly, Garg, Curtis, and Halper (2003) find that IT security software and hardware companies' value increases after denial-of-service attacks in year 2000. T. Wang, Y.-Y. Wang, and Yen (2019) document a negative spillover effect on business value for companies that offer similar products.

#### Auditor Response

Auditors may respond to cybersecurity breaches in several ways. For example, auditors may adjust their audit procedures and include more detailed testing following client cybersecurity issues. The additional effort may lead to higher audit fees. In addition, auditors could contract with clients to perform additional services such as consulting on preventing future cybersecurity issues. Despite auditors' critical role in cybersecurity risk assessment and governance (Hamm 2019b; Institute of Internal Auditors 2019; No and Vasarhelyi 2017; Ovaska-Few 2018; Wallace, Lin, and Cefaratti 2011), there is a dearth of current research focusing on this area. Most studies instead examine auditor characteristics rather than auditor responses. From the external auditor's perspective, both Li, No, and Boritz (2017) and Smith, Higgs, and Pinsker (2019) focus on the association between audit fees and cybersecurity incidents/breaches and suggest that after the breach, auditors increase fees to reflect the change in efforts and increase in risk assessment. Yen et al. (2018) further points out that auditors' experience and expertise play a crucial role in assessing cybersecurity risks, which in turn determine the change in audit fees after clients experience cybersecurity breaches.

From the internal auditor's perspective, Steinbart, Raschke, Gal, and Dilla (2012) suggest several factors that affect information security and internal audit such as internal auditors' knowledge, communication skills, attitude, and top management support. Steinbart, Raschke, Gal, and Dilla (2013) interviewed information systems professionals and demonstrate that internal auditors' technical expertise and review of information security are positively related to the assessment about the quality of the relationship between the internal audit and the information security functions. Steinbart, Raschke, Gal, and Dilla (2018) further find that the quality of the relationship between the internal audit and information security functions can have a positive effect on (1) the number of reported internal control weaknesses, (2) noncompliance incidents, and (3) the number of information security incidents.

#### Regulator Response

Few papers examine regulator response to cybersecurity issues. Regulators may respond to cybersecurity breaches by imposing additional reporting requirements, requiring fines, or suing for damages. Cybersecurity regulation varies by industry. For example, due to the privacy information regulations, hospital and health care organizations deal with significant regulations. Similarly, the financial services industry faces more stringent regulation given it serves a critical role in the nation's security exchanges (SEC 2014). There are various notable regulations in response to recent high-profile cybersecurity breaches. The Cybersecurity Act, which became a federal law in 2015, created a framework to share cybersecurity information among private companies and federal government agencies, authorized the federal government to monitor certain systems and take defensive measures, and implemented measures to improve cybersecurity preparedness of major systems and networks (Cybersecurity Act 2015). In addition to laws and regulations at the federal level, several states, such as Alabama, California, and Iowa, have started to propose or have already passed new data privacy laws.¹⁸ For instance, the California Consumer Privacy Act, passed in June 2018, regulates the confidentiality of personal information and disclosures about breaches related to personal information (California Consumer Privacy Act 2018).

The SEC issued its first cybersecurity guidance in 2011 that acknowledged companies may be obligated to disclose cybersecurity risks and incidents (SEC 2011). Later in 2018, the SEC expanded on this guidance to require that companies disclose cybersecurity risks and incidents that are material to investors (SEC 2018). Also in 2018, the SEC formed a Cyber Unit under its Enforcement Division to target cybersecurity misconduct.

Regulation change has been studied in prior accounting studies.¹⁹ In the context of cybersecurity risks, several studies focus on how regulations affect organizational behaviors. For instance, Gordon et al. (2006) demonstrate that SOX has a positive impact on organizations' disclosures of information security activities after SOX. Li et al. (2018b), based on voluntary disclosure theory, show that after the 2011 SEC guidance on disclosing cybersecurity risks, the association between the presence of cybersecurity risk disclosure and subsequently reported cybersecurity incidents become insignificant, though the disclosures seem to be unrelated to risk levels. Finally, studies look at standard setting and enforcement. For example, Backhouse, Hsu, and Silva (2006), though not focusing specifically on regulatory responses to information security breaches, adopt the theory of circuit of power²⁰ to understand how the first standard in information security management (i.e., ISO 17799) was created.

Though we discuss research examining a wide range of responses to cybersecurity events, research gaps exist. For example, prior research does not examine different internal and external responses, such as cybersecurity insurance. Further, future research could explore how such responses may affect future risk assessments and responses when organizations face security breaches again in the future. Addressing this research gap may be hindered by data availability issues and lack of prior knowledge on external response actions such as cybersecurity insurance.

¹⁹ For instance, Heflin, Subramanyam, and Zhang (2003) find that after Regulation Fair Disclosure (FD), information efficiency of stock prices prior to earnings announcements is improved. Koch, Lefanowicz, and Robinson (2013) provide a comprehensive review of literature regarding Regulation FD. In addition to Regulation FD, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) has also been commonly investigated. For example, Gupta, Weirich, and Turner (2013) provide background information on the legislative efforts toward public reporting on internal controls while DeFond, Hung, Carr, and Zhang (2011) show that the passage of SOX makes bondholders worse off.

²⁰ The circuit of power theory is a social science framework that interprets power, resistance, norms, and cultural relationships in compliance settings.

## V. MAJOR ISSUES AND PRACTITIONER AND RESEARCH IMPLICATIONS

Four major issues emerged from our analysis of existing research as summarized in Table 5. We discuss each issue, with related implications, for cybersecurity practitioners and researchers. We conclude this section by acknowledging challenges to future research.

### Challenges to Detecting Cybersecurity Events

The task of detecting cybersecurity threats, incidents, and breaches can be quite challenging (King 2016). For example, while most agree that cybersecurity risks are critical, organizations are often unprepared to deal with these risks. Given their significant risk assessment knowledge, accountants may play an important role in cybersecurity risk assessment. Research is needed to identify how the rapidly changing risks of cybersecurity may impact the risk assessment process. Further, whether organizations are successful in detecting cybersecurity incidents and breaches is difficult to measure (Forbes 2017; King 2016). In addition, our understanding regarding cybersecurity threat assessment and how employees as well as organizations respond to threats can be enhanced. Further, how can organizations prevent cybersecurity incidents and breaches? Related research is needed to examine how organizations identify cybersecurity problems before they rise to the level of compliance (i.e., cybersecurity breaches).

### Organizational Impact of Cybersecurity Beyond Operational Performance

Though anecdotal evidence suggests that cybersecurity can harm organizations' operational performance and business value, findings from prior studies seem to be mixed (see studies in Table 3). For instance, Cavusoglu et al. (2004) demonstrate a negative impact of security events on business value while Richardson et al. (2019) did not find consistent negative findings by using various metrics. However, such mixed or even contradictory findings may result from the unit of analysis (e.g., breach types or short-term versus long-term) or the measure used. For example, though both focus on the spillover effect of security breaches, Ettredge and Richardson (2003) emphasized only on denial-of-service attacks while Wang et al. (2019) included a wide range of breaches. While the former demonstrates a negative spillover effect to internet firms' industry peers, the latter only finds the negative effect on industry peers with similar products. In addition, studies have argued that cybersecurity breaches may result in the change in operations and reputation loss with compliance/litigation issues. Further, future studies can quantify reputation loss and how compliance/litigation issues may affect an organization's risk profiles or cash flows.

### Broaden Understanding of Responses to Cybersecurity Events

More research is needed to understand an organization's response to cybersecurity breaches, both internally and externally. First, most prior literature in this category did not attempt to build a causal relationship to show the breached organization's responses after the event (e.g., see Table 4, Panel C). Though studies have already shown how organizations respond to cybersecurity events (e.g., how to respond publicly [Gwebu et al. 2018] or how to compensate victims [Goode et al. 2017]), it is unclear how organizations respond to cybersecurity threats, incidents, and breaches through the rearrangement of operational processes, if needed. Internal responses may include change in leadership, composition of the board or the top management team, the different risk-mitigation mechanisms or training, and policy compliance activities. In addition, how will responses affect future security management practices? One dimension that requires additional attention is cybersecurity insurance. More insights about the decision on insurance and its effect can increase our understanding of how this risk-transfer mechanism works compared to other risk-mitigating activities. For instance, is cybersecurity insurance a cost-effective response to cybersecurity risk?

External responses are worth investigating from the point of view of public perception management. Specifically, how do organizations reduce the potential negative consequences of identified cybersecurity breaches by strategically responding to the public? Investor responses to publicly documented cybersecurity challenges is probably the most researched area although questions still exist. For example, does the type of cybersecurity incident or breach disclosed impact investors' reactions? Do professional and nonprofessional investors react differently to cybersecurity challenges? Finally, for regulator responses, new regulations and the corresponding compliance costs and issues may have policy implications.

### Expand Beyond AIS Community

Based on our discussion earlier, cybersecurity studies are mainly performed by IS researchers with only a few exceptions. Specifically, only 40 out of 153 papers in our literature review are from accounting and 25 out of the 40 studies are from accounting information systems journals. As noted by our Event, Impact, Response Framework, cybersecurity issues affect the entire organization. In a recent speech, AAA President Mary Barth noted that financial reporting research identifies information that outside providers of capital need to make their investment decisions (Barth 2018). We argue that in today's environment, outside providers of capital need to evaluate cybersecurity risk information during their decision-making process. Similarly, accountants within organizations depend upon external information for critical decision models. Cybersecurity issues may impact the integrity of this external information. Further, management accountants often are responsible for ensuring that organizational information maintains appropriate privacy and confidentiality standards. Finally, as highlighted in recent speeches by one PCAOB member (Hamm 2019a, 2019b, 2019c), regulators such as the PCAOB and SEC encourage auditors to evaluate clients' cybersecurity issues as part of their risk assessment process.

### Challenges to Future Research

Furthering our knowledge of the relationship between cybersecurity and accounting through future research presents a few challenges. For example, organizations are reluctant to disclose cybersecurity threats and incidents. Thus, researchers need to overcome the hurdle of obtaining appropriate data. In addition, unless cybersecurity events rise to the level of breaches, many organizations are reluctant to disclose their existence. Thus, researchers may need to work with individual organizations and obtain confidential cybersecurity threat and incident data.

## TABLE 5
**Research Summary and Implications**

| **Practitioners** | **Research** |
|-------------------|--------------|
| **Challenges to Detect Cybersecurity Events** |
| Cybersecurity threats, incidents, and breaches are challenging to identify and assess. | Mismatch exists between practitioner and researcher efforts. Practitioners spend more time identifying and assessing cybersecurity threats whereas most research examines cybersecurity breaches given the availability of public breach databases. |
| Newer technologies, such as fuzzy set theory and textual analysis, and different conceptual frameworks can assist organizations in detecting cybersecurity events. | Further research focusing on how organizations can better identify and access cybersecurity threats, incidents, and breaches would be valuable. |
| **Organizational Impact of Cybersecurity Beyond Operational Performance** |
| Mixed results on whether presence of data breach increases likelihood of lower market value. | Existing research investigates impact of cybersecurity on operational performance and business value. |
| How cybersecurity impacts operational, reputational, compliance, and litigation risks is still relative unknown. | More research is needed to understand how cybersecurity impacts operational, reputational, compliance, and litigation risks. |
| **Broaden Understanding of Responses to Cybersecurity Events** |
| Issuing cybersecurity risk management report without assurance is more effective when company has not disclosed prior cybersecurity breach(es). | Current research explores management actions regarding employee training, cybersecurity strategy, investor responses (i.e., market reactions), and auditor responses |
| Composition of the board and the top management team may impact how organizations detect and manage cybersecurity risks. | More research is needed to examine how management monitors public perceptions, invests in additional IT infrastructure, and/or purchases cybersecurity insurance. |
| Stock market values cybersecurity risk management disclosures and cybersecurity awareness. | Further research could explore whether and why interested parties initiate lawsuits. |
| Difficulty to determine whether cybersecurity insurance is appropriate and whether the estimation of losses is reasonable given information regarding cybersecurity losses includes broader factors than used to calculate price of other types of insurance. |
| **Expand Beyond AIS Community** |
| Management information systems and computer science journals include new solutions and conceptual frameworks for detecting cybersecurity threats, incidents, and breaches. | Need to involve financial, managerial, and auditing researchers in cybersecurity issues. |

## VI. DISCUSSION, LIMITATIONS, AND CONCLUSIONS

In today's environment, organizations must protect sensitive personal and corporate financial and non-financial information. As trusted professionals, accountants and auditors play an important role in addressing these cybersecurity issues. This research presents a systematic organizing framework to investigate the impact of cybersecurity on accounting for both practitioners and researchers. We demonstrate how this Event, Impact, Response Framework can be used to categorize existing accounting-related cybersecurity research. Further, we identify four issues regarding cybersecurity based upon our analysis.

First, risk assessment has always been a major issue in accounting. Given the potentially disruptive impact of cybersecurity on all aspects of businesses, cybersecurity risk has now been a major risk assessment item on the board, executive team, and auditors' agenda. However, given rapidly evolving nature of cybersecurity risk and the significant resources organizations expend on addressing this area, research examining how organizations assess and manage cybersecurity threats warrants further examination.

Second, existing research focuses on the operational and business value impact of cybersecurity. However, a wide range of potential impacts requires further understanding such as operational, reputational, compliance, and litigation. Given the significant time lag from the occurrence of the breach to the discovery of the breach and to the time when the company has all the litigation settled and the loss estimated and the lack of publicly available data, it is unclear how these events impact actual operational, reputational, compliance, and litigation risks.

Third, responses to cybersecurity events have not received enough attention given that the response strategy used helps organizations better manage the crisis and to maintain business continuity. These strategies may also assist organizations further fine-tune risk management practices for the future or change subsequent responses or impact when facing another security breach.

Last, most existing cybersecurity research has been conducted by information systems researchers.²¹ Although we acknowledge that more recent studies have been done by accounting researchers, most existing accounting-related cybersecurity research examines how investors react to cybersecurity breach disclosures whether the disclosures were internally prepared by company or externally prepared. In the spirit of Geerts, Graham, Mauldin, McCarthy, and Richardson (2013), we encourage researchers with more financial accounting, managerial accounting, and auditing expertise to consider examining this increasingly important area of accounting. Further, practitioners may find new solutions and conceptual frameworks for detecting cybersecurity events by looking beyond AIS research.

In this research, we separate cybersecurity incidents and breaches depending on whether the event is under the scope of corresponding laws and regulations. We believe this distinction is critical when understanding the reputation, compliance, and litigation issues related to cybersecurity events. Nevertheless, it is still unclear which events may be appropriately categorized as incidents or breaches. In addition, research to better understand related compliance and litigation challenges
