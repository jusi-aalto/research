### Abstract

Despite the importance to researchers, managers, and policy makers of how information technology (IT) contributes to organizational performance, there is uncertainty and debate about what we know and don't know. A review of the literature reveals that studies examining the association between information technology and organizational performance are divergent in how they conceptualize key constructs and their interrelationships. We develop a model of IT business value based on the resource-based view of the firm that integrates the various strands of research into a single framework. We apply the integrative model to synthesize what is known about IT business value and guide future research by developing propositions and suggesting a research agenda. A principal finding is that IT is valuable, but the extent and dimensions are dependent upon internal and external factors, including complementary organizational resources of the firm and its trading partners, as well as the competitive and macro environment. Our analysis provides a blueprint to guide future research and facilitate knowledge accumulation and creation concerning the organizational performance impacts of information technology.

## Introduction

IT business value research examines the organizational performance impacts of information technology. Researchers have adopted myriad approaches to assessing the mechanisms by which IT business value is generated and to estimating its magnitude. Previous research has shown that information technology may indeed contribute to the improvement of organizational performance (Brynjolfsson and Hitt 1996; Kohli and Devaraj 2003; Mukhopadhyay et al. 1995). Moreover, the dimensions and extent of IT business value depend on a variety of factors, including the type of IT, management practices, and organizational structure, as well as the competitive and macro environment (Brynjolfsson et al. 2002; Cooper et al. 2000; Dewan and Kraemer 2000). The research also suggests that firms do not appropriate all of the value they generate from IT; value may be captured by trading partners or competed away and captured by end customers in the form of lower prices and better quality (Bresnahan 1986; Hitt and Brynjolfsson 1996).

By and large, our knowledge has resulted from an organization-centric perspective based on internal business processes, organizational structure, and workplace practices (Bharadwaj 2000; Lichtenberg 1995; Mata et al. 1995). This approach is consistent with computing paradigms that dominated in pre-Internet eras, typically defined by mainframes, minicomputers, and personal computers used primarily for storing and processing information within a single organization. To continue advancing knowledge, however, an expanded conceptualization of IT business value is required.

In the network era, electronic linkages within and among organizations are proliferating, altering the ways in which firms acquire factor inputs, convert them into products and services, and distribute the result to their customers (Hammer 2001; Straub and Watson 2001). This raises new questions about how IT can be applied to improve organizational performance. For example, how do electronically connected trading partners impact a firm's ability to execute IT-based strategies for improved efficiency and competitive advantage? How does the evolving competitive environment shape IT business value? Although emerging studies are beginning to examine pieces of the network-era IT business value puzzle (Chatfield and Yetton 2000; Mukhopadhyay and Kekre 2002), our knowledge remains underdeveloped and unsystematic.

The purpose of this review is to add to knowledge accumulation and creation in the IS academic discipline by summarizing what we know about IT business value and suggesting how we might learn more about what we don't know. Specifically, the objectives of this review are to (1) develop a model of IT business value based in theory and informed by existing IT business value research; (2) use the model to synthesize what is known about IT business value; and (3) guide future research by developing propositions and putting forward a research agenda. The review is unique among other reviews of the IT business value literature in its application of resource-based theory to analyze how IT impacts organizational performance. This approach enables the integration of research assessing both the efficiency implications of IT application as well as its ability to confer a competitive advantage, heretofore separate research conversations. The review is also unique in its extension of the locus of IT business value to the external competitive and macro environment. Another distinction is the inclusion of research studies spanning the entire range of theoretical paradigms and research methods.

There is some ambiguity regarding what constitutes IT business value research, so we begin by introducing terminology and delineating the scope of the research stream. Next, we review theoretical paradigms and modeling approaches employed in prior research. We then develop an integrative model of IT business value using the resource-based view of the firm as a principal theory base. The model provides a basis for structuring our review of accumulated knowledge, for identifying gaps in knowledge, and for developing propositions to guide future research. We conclude by summarizing the findings and limitations of our analysis and by proposing an agenda for future research.²

## IT Business Value Research: Definition Through Distillation

IT business value scholars are motivated by a desire to understand how and to what extent the application of IT within firms leads to improved organizational performance. Researchers have adopted diverse conceptual, theoretical, and analytic approaches and employed various empirical methodologies at multiple levels of analysis (Brynjolfsson 1993; Brynjolfsson and Yang 1996; Dedrick et al. 2003; Wilson 1995). Moreover, the literature includes contributions from several academic disciplines in addition to information systems, including economics, strategy, accounting, and operations research.

Although our knowledge has been enriched by such diversity, an ancillary consequence has been separate research conversations, hampering cross-pollination of ideas and findings and making it difficult for those working outside the area to understand what we have learned (Chan 2000). We, therefore, lay the foundation for model development by analyzing how IT business value researchers have conceptualized IT and IT business value and by defining the research stream, thereby taking a first step toward unification of this vast and diverse body of accumulated knowledge.

### Conceptualizing Information Technology in IT Business Value Research

Information systems scholars have adopted diverse conceptualizations of information technology, extending beyond hardware and software to include a range of contextual factors associated with its application within organizations (Kling 1980; Markus and Robey 1988). As a precise specification of what we mean by IT business value is dependent upon what we mean by IT, we briefly analyze how IT business value researchers have treated the core construct. The result exposes how underlying assumptions about what constitutes IT shape our accumulated knowledge of its organizational performance impacts. Understanding how IT has been conceptualized in prior research also provides a firm foundation from which to derive a systematic and theoretically based definition of information technology within our model derivation.

Five conceptualizations of the IT artifact have been adopted in IS research: (1) tool view, (2) proxy view, (3) ensemble view, (4) computational view, and (5) nominal view (Orlikowski and Iacono 2001). In the first conceptualization, IT is viewed as an engineered tool that does what its designers intended, for example, productivity enhancement and reshaping social relations. Such a view is frequently used within IT business value research, i.e., IT is assumed to be a tool whose intended purpose is to generate value (Table 1). In the proxy view, IT is conceptualized by its essential characteristics, which are defined by individual perceptions of its usefulness or value, the diffusion of a particular type of system within a specific context, and its investment or capital stock denominated in financial units. IT business value researchers often adopt this conceptualization in empirical studies using measures such as capital stock denominated in dollars. The ensemble view is the third conceptualization, focusing on the interaction of people and technology in both the development and use of IT. Case studies examining IT business value within specific organizations often adopt the ensemble view (Kraemer et al. 2000; Williams and Frolick 2001). In addition, as quantitative IT business value research has evolved beyond examining the productivity paradox—low aggregate productivity growth during a period of high IT spending—to explore how firms use IT to generate value, researchers have begun to incorporate the role of organizational co-innovations such as workplace practices (Brynjolfsson et al. 2002). As the emphasis of the fourth view is on algorithm and systems development and testing as well as data modeling and simulation, it is less applicable to IT business value research. Finally, studies adopting the nominal view invoke technology in name but not in fact. An example is the derivation of a two-stage game analyzing the impact of IT application on total factor productivity in the context of oligopolistic competition, which introduces IT solely via its posited impact on cost reduction and product differentiation (Belleflamme 2001).

**Table 1. IT Artifact Conceptualizations Used in IT Business Value Research***  
| **Conceptualization** | **Description** |
|-----------------------|-----------------|
| **Tool** | IT is a tool intended to generate value, whether productivity enhancement, cost reduction, competitive advantage, improved supplier relationships, etc. Specific intention for IT is often unknown. Studies of specific system and implementation contexts enable examination of tool view assumptions. |
| **Proxy** | IT is operationalized via proxies such as capital stock denominated in dollars. Wide range of potential proxies exists, but few have been adopted. Adoption of diverse proxies enables triangulation and enhances accumulated knowledge. |
| **Ensemble** | Assessment of IT business value generation in rich contexts, often using case or field studies. Organizational structure and co-innovations such as workplace practices may be included as moderators or mediators of value. |
| **Nominal** | IT is not conceptualized and appears in name but not in fact. Abstraction enables model precision at the expense of generality. |

*Adapted from Orlikowski and Iacono (2001). Computational conceptualization is not applicable to IT business value research and is omitted from the table.

Examining conceptualizations of IT by IT business value researchers reveals that prevailing assumptions have delimited accumulated knowledge in three principal respects. First, IT is frequently operationalized using aggregate variables measured in dollars or counts of systems (proxy view), limiting our understanding of the differential impacts of alternative types of IT as well as the role of usage (Devaraj and Kohli 2003). Furthermore, software is often treated implicitly via assumptive measures or sometimes omitted entirely from the analysis. Given evidence of its association with firm performance (Hitt et al. 2002), there is a need to incorporate software when conceptualizing IT. Second, IT is frequently assumed to lead to an outcome intended by managers (tool view), limiting our understanding of unintended consequences (Markus and Robey 2004). Third, the treatment of the role of IT employees is unsystematic and often excluded from the analysis (ensemble view), hindering our understanding of the role of IT management and technical expertise in generating IT business value. When included, IS employees have been incorporated in an additive fashion with IT stock (Hitt and Brynjolfsson 1996), as a separate construct that is complementary to IT (Black and Lynch 2001; Brynjolfsson et al. 2002), or conceptualized as being inextricably intertwined with IT within business processes (Kraemer et al. 2000). The problem is exacerbated by increasing adoption of networked systems spanning multiple organizations—and hence multiple IS stakeholder groups.

To summarize, IT business value research is characterized by diverse treatment of the IT construct, which has bounded and shaped accumulated knowledge. A systematic explication and definition based on theory is a necessary first step toward knowledge advancement and model building (undertaken shortly). We now turn to the second core construct of the research stream: IT business value.

### Defining IT Business Value Research

The term IT business value is commonly used to refer to the organizational performance impacts of IT, including productivity enhancement, profitability improvement, cost reduction, competitive advantage, inventory reduction, and other measures of performance (Devaraj and Kohli 2003; Hitt and Brynjolfsson 1996; Kriebel and Kauffman 1988). For example, Mukhopadhyay et al. (1995, p. 138) refer to the "business value of IT" as the "impact of IT on firm performance." Based on our analysis of the IT business value literature (Appendix A), there is no convention regarding the incorporation of costs of system development and implementation. Moreover, researchers have used the term performance to denote both intermediate process-level measures as well as organizational measures. Emphasizing the salience of this distinction, Barua et al. (1995, p. 7) develop a model incorporating both "first-order effects on operational level variables" such as inventory turnover, as well as "higher level variables" such as market share.

Our analysis also revealed the existence of two formulations of performance: efficiency and effectiveness. The former emphasizes an internal perspective employing such metrics as cost reduction and productivity enhancement in the assessment of a given business process, or "doing things right" (Drucker 1966). In contrast, effectiveness denotes the achievement of organizational objectives in relation to a firm's external environment and may be manifested in the attainment of competitive advantage, i.e., effecting a unique value-creating strategy with respect to competitors (Barney 1991). To emphasize, IT may enable a firm to improve efficiency regardless of whether mimicked by competitors, or may yield performance impacts unique to a particular firm relative to its competitors, i.e., competitive impacts. Synthesizing these observations, we define IT business value as the organizational performance impacts of information technology at both the intermediate process level and the organization-wide level, and comprising both efficiency impacts and competitive impacts.

Several reviews of the literature focus on studies using quantitative empirical methodologies (Brynjolfsson and Yang 1996; Dedrick et al. 2003; Dehning and Richardson 2002).³ Based on our definition of IT business value, the scope of IT business value research includes conceptual, theoretical, analytic, and empirical studies. Conceptual and theoretical studies apply theory and grounded observation to explicate IT business value (Mata et al. 1995; Porter 2001; Soh and Markus 1995). Analytic studies utilize game theoretic and other modeling techniques to develop models of IT business value whose solutions inform our understanding of the organizational performance implications of alternative IT investment and ownership regimes as well as the role of the competitive environment (Bakos and Nault 1997; Belleflamme 2001; Clemons and Kleindorfer 1992). Finally, empirical studies include qualitative research—case studies and field studies (Clemons and Row 1988; Cooper et al. 2000)—and quantitative studies estimating IT business value at the process, business unit, firm, industry, and country levels of analysis (Alpar and Kim 1990; Dewan and Kraemer 2000; Siegel 1997). Combining these observations, we define IT business value research as any conceptual, theoretical, analytic, or empirical study that examines the organizational performance impacts of IT.

³ See Kohli and Devaraj (2003) for a meta-analysis of quantitative empirical IT business value studies.

Having demonstrated how prevailing assumptions about the IT artifact in IT business value studies have delimited what we know and defined the research stream, we now turn to the derivation of our integrative model.

## Integrative Model of IT Business Value

The organizational application of information technology may improve, reduce, or have no effect on firm performance. Our objective is to develop a descriptive model of the value generating process. The primary theory base is the resource-based view (RBV) of the firm, which combines the rationale of economics with a management perspective. As trading partners and the competitive environment shape the degree to which IT may improve organizational performance, we also appeal to secondary theory bases, including microeconomics and the related industrial organization literature. To motivate the selection of RBV as our primary theory base, we begin by summarizing the theoretical paradigms that have been used in prior studies.

### Theoretical Paradigms Used in IT Business Value Research

Researchers have employed several theoretical paradigms in examining the organizational performance impacts of IT, including microeconomics, industrial organization theory, and sociology and socio-political paradigms.

#### Microeconomic Theory

Microeconomic theory provides a rich set of well-defined constructs interrelated via theoretical models and mathematical specifications. The theory of production has been particularly useful in conceptualizing the process of production and providing empirical specifications enabling estimation of the economic impact of IT (Brynjolfsson and Hitt 1995; Dewan and Min 1997; Lichtenberg 1995). Researchers have also employed growth accounting (Brynjolfsson and Hitt 2003; Jorgenson and Stiroh 1999), consumer theory (Brynjolfsson 1996; Hitt and Brynjolfsson 1996), data envelopment analysis (Lee and Barua 1999), and Tobin's q (Bharadwaj et al. 1999; Brynjolfsson and Yang 1997). To account for the inherent risk and uncertainty of IT investments, option pricing models have been applied to the IT context. Conducting a real-options analysis of point-of-sale (POS) debit services by an electronic banking network, Benaroch and Kauffman (1999, p. 84) describe "the logic of option pricing" as "how it can handle getting the timing right, scaling up or even abandonment, as the organization learns about its business environment with the passage of time." Although the assumptions of microeconomic theory must be carefully assessed within the specific research context, its application within IT business value research has enhanced our understanding of wide-ranging phenomena.

#### Industrial Organization Theory

IT business value researchers have drawn from the industrial organization literature to examine how firms jointly interact in IT investment decisions and how the resulting benefits are divided. Game theory has been used to examine the role of strategic interaction among competitors in IT business value generation and capture. Belleflamme (2001) constructs a two-stage game of IT investment and production choice under oligopolistic competition. Other researchers have drawn from agency theory and the incomplete contracts literature (Bakos and Nault 1997; Clemons and Kleindorfer 1992). Transaction cost theory has also informed understanding of the role of IT in reducing transaction costs (Clemons and Row 1991b; Gurbaxani and Whang 1991).

#### Sociology and Socio-Political Perspectives

Although the system rationalism perspective—maximization of organizational efficiency and effectiveness through IT as the common goal of all organizational stakeholders (Kling 1980)—is widespread within IT business value research, other perspectives have also informed understanding. Economic activity is embedded in social networks (Granovetter 1985); according to Uzzi (1997, p. 35) "embeddedness is a logic of exchange that promotes economies of time, integrative agreements, Pareto improvements in allocative efficiency, and complex adaptation." IT researchers have applied the theory of embeddedness to inform understanding of how interorganizational relationships impact IT business value in the context of EDI (Chatfield and Yetton 2000). The socio-political perspective has been used to examine the relationship between IT investment and firm performance (Hoogeveen and Oppelland 2002). Kumar et al. (1998) propose a rationality of information systems that stresses relationships and trust within and across organizations and apply it to explain the failure of an interorganizational information system implemented in the textile industry.⁴

⁴ For a summary of the positivism, realism, critical theory, and constructivism paradigms as they relate to IT business value, see Cronk and Fitzgerald (2002).

The complex problem of linking IT to organizational performance is informed by the insights of multiple theoretical paradigms. However, the absence of a unified theoretical framework has led to a fractured research stream with many simultaneous but non-overlapping conversations (Chan 2000). We thus seek to develop a conceptual model that is not only based in theory, but rooted in one that is inherently suitable for analyzing the complexity of IT and firm performance. Ideally, it would have a robust logical formulation, while enabling study of the rich contextual processes associated with managing IT for business value.

### Chosen Theory Base: Resource-Based View of the Firm

The resource-based view of the firm (RBV) emphasizes heterogeneous firm resource endowments as a basis for competitive advantage (Table 2). It is grounded in the seminal work of economists concerned with firm heterogeneity and imperfect competition (Chamberlin 1933; Robinson 1933). These early theorists emphasize the importance of firm heterogeneity—as against market structure—in conferring above normal profits and in driving imperfect competition. In her theory of firm growth, Penrose (1959) refines these ideas by conceptualizing the firm as a bundle of resources within an administrative framework. Evolutionary economists combining Schumpeterian competition with tacit processes and routines further extend thinking away from static equilibrium models of classical microeconomics (Nelson and Winter 1982). A seminal contribution to resource-based theory is provided by Wernerfelt (1984), who proposes the notion of resource position barriers, i.e., barriers to imitation, and links resource attributes to profitability. Subsequent research studies examine how resource attributes lead to competitive advantage (Amit and Schoemaker 1993; Dierickx and Cool 1989; Peteraf 1993) and extend the RBV in various ways, including the analysis of resources in the context of interconnected organizations (Dovev 2002).

In contrast to undifferentiated factor inputs with well-defined property rights, resources are firm-specific, difficult to imitate, and often valuable, i.e., they enable the firm to improve efficiency (Teece et al. 1997). Barney (1991) specifies the conditions required for a resource to confer a competitive advantage. If the valuable resource is rare, i.e., few firms have access to it, it confers a temporary competitive advantage. If it is also imperfectly imitable—for example, competitors don't know what factors lead to success and therefore what to imitate—and there are no readily available substitutes, the resource confers a sustained competitive advantage. In this case, the firm is using the resource to implement "a value creating strategy not simultaneously being implemented by any current or potential competitors" and one that its rivals are unable to duplicate (Barney 1991, p. 102). In summary, the four conditions necessary for a resource to confer a sustainable competitive advantage are value, rareness, inimitability, and non-substitutability. We adopt Barney's formulation as it is readily applicable to analyzing the fundamental questions of IT business value.

**Table 2. Resource-Based Theory: Intellectual Foundations and Theory Development**

**Intellectual Foundations**

- **Theory of imperfect competition (Robinson 1933)**  
  Industries are neither perfect monopolies nor do they operate under perfect competition. Critique of neoclassical economic theory—each of many competing firms has some monopoly power.
- **Theory of monopolistic competition (Chamberlin 1933; Chamberlin 1937)**  
  Merges theory of monopoly (but no free entry) and perfect competition (but allows for product differentiation) in a model of monopolistic competition. Supplier has some control over price.
- **Theory of firm growth (Penrose 1959)**  
  Distinction between services rendered by inputs to production upon purchase versus the larger set of resulting services when integrated in the firm. The speed of accumulation and assimilation of resources is key to firm growth, as are opportunities arising from underutilization of its resources. Firms continually search for new ways to increase productivity and efficiency. New knowledge yields new ways of using existing resources or new ways of combining sets of resources. The firm thus "is basically a collection of resources" (Penrose 1959, p. 77).

**Theory Development**

- **Resource-based view of the firm (Wernerfelt 1984)**  
  Resources are anything that can be viewed as a strength or weakness of a firm. Resource position barriers, i.e., imitation barriers, can lead to above-normal profit. Strategy comprises current resource exploitation and new resource development, emphasized in the resource-product matrix that contrasts a firm's resources with its products.
- **Resource heterogeneity and above normal firm performance**  
  Resource factors differ in the extent to which they can be identified and their monetary value assessed via strategic factor markets (Barney 1986b). Through isolating mechanisms, once homogenous firms become differentiated and in possession of difficult to imitate resources (Rumelt 1984). Economic rent is derived from time compression diseconomies in trying to imitate resources of other firms as well as in limited substitutability (Dierickx and Cool 1989).
- **Identification of resources that confer a sustained competitive advantage**  
  Proposed sets of conditions for a resource to confer a sustained competitive advantage include (1) value, rareness, inimitability, and non-substitutability (Barney 1991) and (2) heterogeneity of efficiency in industry, ex post limits to competition, ex ante limits to competition, and immobility (Peteraf 1993). Specific resources examined include entrepreneurship (Rumelt 1987), culture (Barney 1986a), routines (Nelson and Winter 1982), invisible assets (Itami 1987), human resources (Amit and Schoemaker 1993), and information technology (Bharadwaj 2000; Mata et al. 1995).
- **Bundling of resources**  
  Distinction between resources and the capability to deploy groups of resources successfully (Grant 1991; Teece et al. 1997).

#### RBV and IT Business Value

The resource-based view has been used to examine the efficiency and competitive advantage implications of specific firm resources such as entrepreneurship (Rumelt 1987), culture (Barney 1986a), and organizational routines (Nelson and Winter 1982). It is also useful in the IT context, providing a robust framework for analyzing whether and how IT may be associated with competitive advantage. Strategy researchers have applied RBV to theoretically analyze the competitive advantage implications of information technology (Mata et al. 1995) and to assess empirically the complementarities between IT and other firm resources (Powell and Dent-Micallef 1997). IS researchers have also begun to employ the resource perspective to expand and deepen our understanding of IT business value (Bharadwaj 2000; Caldeira and Ward 2003; Clemons 1991; Jarvenpaa and Leidner 1998; Santhanam and Hartono 2003). Such research provides a firm foundation from which to derive our integrative model. Thus, due to its firm roots in microeconomics, its focus on resource attributes, and its usefulness in examining the IT resource, we choose the resource-based view of the firm as the primary theoretical foundation. Its "integration of a management perspective with an economics perspective" (Peteraf and Barney 2003, p. 309) provides the balance that we require for the development of an integrative IT business value model.⁵

⁵ For a debate of the merits of the resource-based view, see the critique of Priem and Butler (2001) and response by Barney (2001).

A limitation of the conventional resource-based view is that it assumes that resources are always applied in their best uses, saying little about how this is done. In effect, the RBV provides a set of necessary conditions to the attainment of sustainable competitive advantage via a firm resource, but does not specify the underlying mechanisms by which this is accomplished. We, therefore, rely on secondary theory bases such as microeconomics as well as accumulated IT business value knowledge to inform understanding of how the IT resource is applied within business processes to improve performance. Having described our chosen theory base, we begin derivation of the model by examining how other researchers have modeled IT business value.

### Prior Models

An examination of IT business value models employed in prior research informs our choices concerning which constructs to include and how to model their interrelationships. The widely used production function approach relates production inputs such as labor, IT, and other capital to output via mathematical specifications derived from microeconomic theory. Other researchers have developed process-oriented models linking IT to organizational performance. Barua et al. (1995) argue that the association between IT investment and performance attenuates as the distance between cause and effect widens. The authors develop a model of IT business value in which the impact of IT on firm performance is mediated by intermediate processes. A similar perspective is adopted by Weill (1992), who focuses on the ability of firms to convert IT assets into organizational performance, identifying several conversion effectiveness factors that mediate the IT-performance relationship. Francalanci and Galal (1998) propose that managerial choices regarding the mix of clerical, managerial, and professional employees mediate the relationship between IT and firm performance. In a synthesis of process models, Soh and Markus (1995) develop a conceptual framework which posits that IT investment leads to IT assets (IT conversion process), IT assets to IT impacts (IT use process), and IT impacts to organizational performance (competitive process).

Production function and process-oriented models describe the relationship between IT investment and firm performance via an input-output perspective that sometimes includes intermediate factors such as managerial choices and organizational structure. However, the external environment of trading partners, industry characteristics, and socio-political conditions is also important, but rarely incorporated (cf. Chatfield and Yetton 2000; Jarvenpaa and Leidner 1998). Moreover, production function and process models typically treat the IT artifact in a stylized fashion.

Other researchers have taken an alternative approach in modeling IT business value by focusing on the attributes of IT and other organizational resources that together may confer a competitive advantage. Bharadwaj (2000) models three key IT resources and their relationship to a firm's capability to deploy IT for improved performance: IT infrastructure, human IT resources, and IT-enabled intangibles. Clemons and Row (1991b) argue that IT is widely available to all firms and can only confer a sustainable competitive advantage if applied to leverage differences in strategic resources. Mata et al. (1995) derive a resource-based conceptual framework mapping the attributes of IT to competitive advantage. According to the framework, the extent to which IT is valuable, heterogeneous, and imperfectly mobile determines the level of competitive advantage. If IT is valuable in lowering costs or enhancing revenue for all firms, then competitive parity results. If it is also heterogeneous, i.e., if one firm possesses it and others do not, then the firm receives a temporary competitive advantage. Finally, if IT is also imperfectly mobile—firms without the resource face a cost disadvantage in acquiring it, the sources of which may include the role of history, causal ambiguity, and social complexity—then IT confers a sustained competitive advantage. Although Mata et al. conclude that only IT management skills may lead to sustained competitive advantage, they acknowledge that "there may be other attributes of IT whose competitive implications have not been fully evaluated" (p. 500).

As with production function and process-oriented models, models analyzing the attributes of IT and complementary firm resources typically do not incorporate the external environment of trading partners, industry characteristics, and country characteristics. Moreover, based on an analysis of emergent research, there is no consensus regarding approaches to modeling such factors. For example, Mukhopadhyay et al. (1995) relate EDI penetration, EDI program launching, and EDI penetration volume to inventory turnover, obsolete inventory, and premium freight. In contrast, Chatfield and Yetton (2000) extend the MIT 90s model (Scott Morton 1991) to explore the relationship between EDI imitator and EDI adopter.

In summary, analyzing prior IT business value models reveals that (1) IT impacts organizational performance via intermediate business processes; (2) other organizational resources such as workplace practices interact with IT, whether as mediator or moderator, in the attainment of organizational performance impacts; (3) the external environment plays a role in IT business value generation; and (4) it is important to disaggregate the IT construct into meaningful subcomponents. The received wisdom of IT business value models can thus be summarized as follows: if the right IT is applied within the right business process, improved processes and organizational performance result, conditional upon appropriate complementary investments in workplace practices and organizational structure and shaped by the competitive environment. Although a compelling narrative, as evidenced by the wide array of modeling approaches, we lack a systematic approach supported by theory for examining associated questions. What is meant by IT? What is meant by business process? What is the right IT for the right business process? What is the role of other firm resources, trading partners, and the competitive environment? We develop a theoretically based model of IT business value that systematizes and extends accumulated knowledge and addresses these questions.

### Model Derivation

Based on our analysis of how other researchers have modeled IT business value, we conclude that the locus of IT business value generation is the organization that invests in and deploys IT resources, which we call the focal firm. But external factors also play a role in shaping the extent to which IT business value can be generated and captured. In particular, the competitive environment, including industry characteristics and trading partners, as well as the macro environment are salient to IT business value generation. We thus derive an integrative model of IT business value that comprises three domains: (1) focal firm; (2) competitive environment; and (3) macro environment. Using the resource-based view as a primary theoretical lens, the model describes how phenomena resident within each domain shape the relationship between IT and organizational performance (Figure 1).

**Figure 1. IT Business Value Model**  
[Note: Figure not included in text; describe as a conceptual diagram illustrating three domains—focal firm, competitive environment, and macro environment—shaping the relationship between IT and organizational performance.]

#### Focal Firm

The first domain is the organization acquiring and deploying the IT resource—the focal firm. Within the focal firm, IT business value is generated by the deployment of IT and complementary organizational resources within business processes. As illustrated in Figure 1, application of IT and complementary organizational resources may improve business processes or enable new ones, which ultimately may impact organizational performance (Brynjolfsson and Hitt 2000). The focal firm domain thus comprises the IT resource, complementary organizational resources, business processes, business process performance, and organizational performance.

##### Information Technology Resource

Based on the analysis of how IT business value researchers have treated the IT artifact, the predominant approach has been either (1) to use aggregate variables such as corporate IT expenditure or counts of systems in quantitative empirical studies, or (2) to take a holistic approach in exploring the interdependencies between IT and human resources in the creation of business value within case and field studies. Other researchers have attempted to develop a more generalized view of IT. For example, in their review and synthesis of quantitative empirical IT business value research, Dehning and Richardson (2002) identify three different formulations of IT: IT spending, IT strategy (type of IT), and IT management/capability. Likewise, Bharadwaj (2000) derives IT infrastructure, human IT resources, and IT-enabled intangibles such as customer orientation and knowledge as principal IT-based resources. Based on a survey of top IT executives at 50 firms, Ross et al. (1996) identify three IT assets underlying a firm's IT capability: human, technology, and relationship.

To operationalize the IT resource, we meld these formulations with Barney's (1991) classification of firm resources into physical capital, human capital, and organizational capital resources, the former two containing components of the IT resource, while all three contain components of complementary organizational resources.

- **Physical capital resources** comprise plant and equipment, geographic location, access to raw materials, and physical technology, a subset of which is the **technological IT resource (TIR)**. TIR can be further categorized into (1) **IT infrastructure**, i.e., shared technology and technology services across the organization, and (2) **specific business applications** that utilize the infrastructure, i.e., purchasing systems, sales analysis tools, etc. (Broadbent and Weill 1997). TIR thus includes both hardware and software (Table 3). The separation of TIR into infrastructure and business applications is consistent with how companies view their physical IT assets, an important consideration as firms view the two in different ways when making investment decisions and setting performance expectations (Weill et al. 2002).
- The second resource is the firm's **human capital**, which refers to expertise and knowledge (Barney 1991), and we thus call the second component of the IT resource the **human IT resource (HIR)**. Similar to prior characterizations (Bharadwaj 2000; Dehning and Richardson 2002; Ross et al. 1996), HIR denotes both technical and managerial knowledge. Examples of technical expertise include application development, integration of multiple systems, and maintenance of existing systems; managerial skills include the ability to identify appropriate projects, marshal adequate resources, and lead and motivate development teams to complete projects according to specification and within time and budgetary constraints. Although technical and managerial expertise are often intertwined, they are nonetheless distinct concepts, and their conceptualization as such is necessary for precision in describing IT investment impacts. Human IT expertise may be associated with the entire technological infrastructure of the organization or may reside locally within business units and be associated with specific business applications.

##### Complementary Organizational Resources

Although it is possible to apply IT for improved organizational performance with few organizational changes (McAfee 2002), successful application of IT is often accompanied by significant organizational change (Brynjolfsson and Hitt 2000; Brynjolfsson et al. 2002; Cooper et al. 2000), including policies and rules, organizational structure, workplace practices, and organizational culture. When synergies between IT and other firm resources exist, we call the latter **complementary organizational resources**. The RBV literature provides guidance regarding the classification of complementary organizational resources. Returning to Barney's (1991) classification of firm resources, complementary organizational resources may include non-IT physical capital resources, non-IT human capital resources, and organizational capital resources, e.g., formal reporting structures and informal relationships within and among firms.⁶

⁶ Similarly, Grant (1991) classifies non-IT resources into five categories: (1) physical, (2) human, (3) organizational, (4) reputation, and (5) financial.

##### Business Processes

According to Davenport (1993, p. 5), a business process is "the specific ordering of work activities across time and space, with a beginning, an end, and clearly identified inputs and outputs." In essence, business processes are the activities residing in the black box of microeconomic production theory that transform a set of inputs into outputs. From the perspective of resource-based theory, business processes provide a context within which to examine the locus of direct resource exploitation. Examples of business processes include order taking, PC assembly, and distribution. A single firm executes numerous business processes to achieve its strategic objectives, thereby providing a range of opportunities for the application of information technology to improve processes and organizational performance (Porter and Millar 1985). In the net-enabled organization (Straub and Watson 2001), IT not only may improve individual processes, but also may enable process synthesis and integration across disparate physical and organizational boundaries (Basu and Blanning 2003).

##### Performance

Performance comprises **business process performance** as well as **organizational performance**. The former denotes a range of measures associated with operational efficiency enhancement within specific business processes, such as quality improvement of design processes and enhanced cycle time within inventory management processes. Examples of business process performance metrics used in prior IT business value research include on-time shipping (McAfee 2002), customer satisfaction (Devaraj and Kohli 2000), and inventory turnover (Barua et al. 1995). In contrast, organizational performance denotes aggregate IT-enabled performance impacts across all firm activities, with metrics capturing bottom-line firm impacts such as cost reduction, revenue enhancement, and competitive advantage. IT business value researchers have operationalized these measures via operations measures (cost reduction, productivity enhancement, etc.) and market-based measures (stock market valuation, Tobin's q, etc.) (Dehning and Richardson 2002). However, the range of potential measures is not limited to financial metrics, and may include perceptual measures, usage metrics, and others (Tallon et al. 2000).

Resource-based theory informs understanding of the linkage between the type of IT and the nature of business process and organizational performance impacts. For example, upon its introduction, the SABRE airline computerized reservation system was valuable and rare, thus conferring a temporary competitive advantage (Hopper 1990). However, imitation over time and diminished rareness weakened such advantages. Regarding the conversion of business process performance impacts to improved organizational performance, several factors are salient, including the scope of the business process, the extent to which it is core to the organization, the rareness of the particular IT in question, as well as the competitive environment (Kohli 2003).

#### Competitive Environment

The second domain in the integrative model is the **competitive environment** in which the focal firm operates, which we separate into two components: industry characteristics and trading partners. Industry characteristics include competitiveness, regulation, technological change, clockspeed, and other factors that shape the way in which IT is applied within the focal firm to generate business value (Devaraj and Kohli 2003; Hill and Scudder 2002; Jorgenson et al. 2003; Kettinger et al. 1994; Kraemer et al. 2000). In addition to industry characteristics, the competitive environment also includes the focal firm's trading partners. When IT spans firm boundaries, the business processes, IT resources, and non-IT resources of trading partners play a role in the IT business value generation of the focal firm (Chatfield and Yetton 2000; Mukhopadhyay and Kekre 2002; Williams and Frolick 2001). We thus include industry characteristics and trading partners in the competitive environment domain.

##### Industry Characteristics

The organization of industries—concentration, supply chain configuration, etc.—as well as their salient features—technological change, regulation, IT standards, etc.—can shape how IT is used within focal firm business processes to create IT business value. For example, the competitive characteristics of strategic factor markets, including the IT resource, affect the degree to which a firm can enjoy above-normal returns (Barney 1986b). Another example is the high degree of unionization in such industries as telecommunications and auto manufacturing that may hamper a firm's ability to substitute IT for labor or to implement complementary work practices such as cross-functional work teams. The resulting suboptimal application of IT may limit IT business value generation. Alternatively, in time-sensitive industries such as personal computers and apparel, there is ample opportunity to apply IT to reduce cycle times, better manage inventory, and improve customer satisfaction (Ghemawat and Nueno 2003; Kraemer et al. 2000). The findings of quantitative empirical studies that certain industries attain higher IT productivity impacts and greater cost reduction than others provide further support for the inclusion of industry characteristics in our model (Lewis et al. 2002; Morrison 1997).

Industry characteristics apply to all firms in an industry. However, the response of industry competitors vis-a-vis information technology is not necessarily uniform. It is thus necessary to account for heterogeneity across industries as well as alternative response strategies among industry competitors to the same set of industry stimuli when examining the role of industry characteristics on IT business value.

##### Trading Partner Resources and Business Processes

Information technology increasingly permeates organizational boundaries, linking multiple firms via electronic networks and software applications and melding their business processes (Basu and Blanning 2003; Hammer 2001; Mukhopadhyay and Kekre 2002; Straub and Watson 2001). As a result, trading partners increasingly impact the generation of IT business value for the focal firm (Bakos and Nault 1997; Chatfield and Yetton 2000; Clemons and Row 1993). For example, inefficient business processes and antiquated technology within trading partner firms may inhibit the attainment of IT business value of an interorganizational system initiated by the focal firm. In some cases, this may give rise to incentives for the focal firm to team with the trading partner for joint improvement (Williams and Frolick 2001). We thus adapt our formulation of IT, business processes, and organizational complements to the focal firm's trading partners, which provides the conceptual foundation for understanding their impact on focal firm IT business value generation. For example, the ability to partner with external IT units in development and implementation would be included in the human IT resource of both the focal and external organization. Another example is poor work practices within a supplier firm that inhibit its full use of a procurement system introduced by the focal buyer firm.

#### Macro Environment

The third and final domain in our integrative model is the **macro environment**, which includes country-level factors that shape IT application and value generation. These factors include the level of economic development, basic infrastructure, education, research and development investment, population growth rate, and cultural characteristics, among others.

**Table 7. Macro Environment Propositions**

| **Proposition** | **Description** |
|------------------|---------------|
| **5A** | The macro environment shapes the degree to which firms can apply IT for organizational improvement. |
| **5B** | Telecommunications infrastructure—a complementary and potentially co-specialized asset with the IT resource—moderates the economic value of an interorganizational information system to the focal firm and its trading partners; the extent of moderation varies depending on the organizational and technological context. |

##### Research Question 5: What is the role of country characteristics in shaping IT business value?

The structure and institutions of economies and the increasingly interconnected global business environment affect firms' IT choices and resulting organizational performance outcomes (Van Den Ende et al. 2001). Certain macro factors may constrain firms' choices; for example, a poor telecommunications infrastructure inhibits Web-based supply chain integration. In contrast, trade liberalization, financial safeguards for online transactions, and tax subsidies may support and promote the application of IT for operational efficiencies and competitive advantage. However, beyond casual observation we know very little about the association between macro characteristics and IT business value.

Two factors have inhibited knowledge accumulation concerning macro characteristics and IT business value: (1) emphasis on U.S. firms and (2) lack of cross-country studies. IT business value researchers have focused on U.S. firms. As such, results are conditional on the characteristics of the U.S. business environment, including relatively liberal trade policies, an advanced information infrastructure, a relatively well-educated workforce, and relatively competitive markets. The second reason for a paucity of knowledge related to the international perspective of IT business value is that very few studies have explored IT business value using cross-country samples. Thus, although several studies have examined firms outside the U.S., including Brazil (Tigre and Botelho 2001), France (Jelassi and Figon 1994), Mexico (Jarvenpaa and Leidner 1998), and the United Kingdom (Stoneman and Kwon 1996), it is difficult to draw conclusions regarding the impact of macro factors as research designs do not enable incorporation of appropriate control variables. We use resource-based theory and results from other management literatures to inform the macro context.

The RBV informs understanding of IT business value in the macro context by providing a framework to examine performance implications concerning the variation of human and technological components of the IT resource across nations. Researchers have applied the resource-based view to assess why some firms "possess unique resources and competencies—relative to their competitors of other nationalities" (Dunning 1995, p. 466). In the IT context, the extent to which IT skills are widely available in a given country is a determinant of their rareness and heterogeneity, two attributes required for a sustained competitive advantage (Barney 1991). This point is underscored in the study by Jarvenpaa and Leidner (1998), which emphasizes the salience of investing in technology skills, hiring top IT talent often educated abroad, and forming exclusive arrangements with partners possessing complementary IT skills in gaining a competitive advantage via IT in a developing country. Moreover, if complementary organizational innovations are more widely available in one nation relative to another, the former economy may benefit from productivity gains, while the latter may not.

In addition to variation in the IT resource across countries, exogenous factors may also affect the degree to which IT can be used to improve organizational performance. Path dependencies may play a role in determining the types of IT that are demanded, how they are used, and their economic impact (Tigre and Botelho 2001). For example, Brousseau (2003) finds that the preexisting organization of distribution channels and interfirm relationships is salient to adoption and assimilation of e-commerce in France. Differences in the extent to which technological improvements diffuse in the U.S. versus other developed nations are suggested to play a role in observed differences in productivity growth (Gust and Marquez 2001). The confluence of EDI, organizational transformation, and public policy are illustrated in a study of Singapore's TradeNet (Teo et al. 1997). EDI at TradeNet resulted in substantial gains in efficiency and effectiveness, illustrating the degree to which promotion of IT can provide benefits to both the private and public sector.

In summary, the role of the macro environment in affecting the degree to which firms apply IT for organizational improvement is complex and not systematically understood. However, research and theory suggest that macro characteristics vary by country, create country-specific sets of IT attributes, and thereby impact firms' IT choices and resultant organizational performance impacts. Additionally, other macro factors such as culture and education also impact the ability of organizations to apply IT successfully. We summarize this finding in the following:

**Proposition 5A:** The macro environment shapes the degree to which firms can apply IT for organizational improvement.

The macro environment is dynamic and complex, and there is a paucity of IT business value research in this area. However, examining the range of macro factors that potentially shape IT business value generation, telecommunications infrastructure, and, in particular, Internet diffusion would appear to be an important factor enabling firms to apply IT for improved performance.

Telecommunications infrastructure varies widely across countries (OECD 2003). As an example, according to the Hemisphere Wide Inter-University Scientific and Technological Information Network (2003), Internet host density (number of hosts per 100 inhabitants) in Latin America as of January 2003 varies from a low of .002 in Honduras to a high of 2.3 in Uruguay—a difference of three orders of magnitude. Given such variation, researchers have explored how heterogeneity in telecommunications infrastructure may be associated with macro performance. Roller and Waverman (2001) find empirically that the extent of telecommunications infrastructure is associated with economic growth. Other researchers have analyzed the potential impact of Internet diffusion on growth and productivity across countries (Varian 2002).

According to Straub and Watson (2001, p. 338), "The net-enabled organization (NEO) coordinates its activities and interacts with its stakeholders through the exchange of messages over electronic networks." Having squeezed most of the efficiencies out of internal connectivity, organizations are looking to their external environment to coordinate the production and delivery of goods and services, with the potential for orders of magnitude increases in efficiency (Hammer 2001). However, without a sufficient telecommunications infrastructure, i.e., broad diffusion of high-speed Internet connections throughout the economy, the resulting network externalities and net-enabled efficiencies are limited. Emerging empirical evidence of differences in IT business value across developed and developing countries may be a manifestation of differences in Internet diffusion (Dewan and Kraemer 2000; Tam 1998).

From the perspective of resource-based theory, telecommunications infrastructure is not a resource in the conventional sense as it is not owned and operated by the focal firm. Rather, it can be conceptualized as a country-specific asset available to all firms. As firms and their trading partners adopt and co-specialize their own IT to the telecom infrastructure, the extent of generated IT business value is likely to increase. However, the circumstances under which this occurs are unclear due to a lack of prior research. Thus, although differences in telecommunications infrastructure across countries enable varying opportunities of co-specialization with focal firm IT resources, the nature of resulting benefits in specific contexts is uncertain. Due to a lack of empirical evidence, therefore, we cannot say whether the role of telecommunications infrastructure in shaping IT business value is of an efficiency or competitive nature. We thus propose that

**Proposition 5B:** Telecommunications infrastructure—a complementary and potentially co-specialized asset with the IT resource—moderates the economic value of an interorganizational information system to the focal firm and its trading partners; the extent of moderation varies depending on the organizational and technological context.

## Discussion

Several streams of research are concerned with assessing the organizational performance implications of information technology, each bringing its own theoretical and empirical toolkit to bear upon similar research questions. Unfortunately, these approaches are divergent and the result has been analogous to multiple but separate communication channels traversing a single pipe of inquiry into the organizational performance impacts of IT. The lack of integration has led to ambiguity and debate over basic principles, extending beyond the IS research community. The topic is vital to public policy makers, the IT industry, and IS practitioners, as exemplified by the recent debate over whether IT matters initiated in Harvard Business Review by Nicholas Carr (2003) arguing that firms have overestimated the strategic value of IT and overspent on the commodity that is IT. Our analysis has illuminated these issues through the lens of a robust theoretical framework.

Although we could not have anticipated the emergence of this new debate at the outset of our research effort, our analysis of accumulated IT business value knowledge speaks directly to it. Examining prior reviews of the literature convinced us that the integration of ideas across the various strands of research via a common theoretical lens was not only a unique approach, but also one that would likely yield the greatest contribution to knowledge. Our approach was thus to integrate quantitative empirical research addressing the productivity paradox, conceptual and empirical studies assessing the competitive advantage implications of IT, and qualitative empirical research assessing general performance impacts of IT within a single conceptual framework of IT business value. Comparing and contrasting articles across research strands led to the insight that although the focal firm bounds the locus of direct performance impacts, the external environment shapes them. Synthesizing the internal and external perspectives using resource-based theory enabled us to identify what we know and what we don't know and suggest illustrative propositions, the future assessment of which will, we hope, expedite knowledge advancement.

We have learned that IT is valuable, offering an extensive menu of potential benefits ranging from flexibility and quality improvement to cost reduction and productivity enhancement. Our analysis also suggests that the synergies resulting from technical and human IT resources likely result in short-lived competitive advantages. Regarding the mechanisms by which value is achieved, we learned that the high degree of complexity leads to a context-contingent set of synergistic combinations of IT and other organizational resources, including workplace practices, change initiatives, organizational structure, and financial condition. Further examination of the attributes of such complementary resources led to the proposition that under conditions of sufficient rarity and nonsubstitutability, the more difficult they are to imitate, the more likely is the attainment of a sustained competitive advantage.

Moving to the external environment, examination of differential impacts across industries suggested that industry characteristics such as regulation may constrain IT business value. In contrast, other facets of industry structure such as rapid technological change may enable leaders to constantly innovate and maintain their IT-based competitive advantages. Refinement of this argument led to the proposition that the relationship of IT-enabled profitability and productivity enhancement (Hitt and Brynjolfsson 1996) may be moderated by the level of industry competitiveness. We also found that trading partners play a critical role in shaping the generation and determining the capture of focal firm IT business value when they are electronically linked. In particular, we posited that power is reinforced within IOS, i.e., IT reinforces preexisting power imbalances, enabling lead firms to capture a disproportionate amount of value. Moving to the final layer in our IT business value model, we found that a variety of public policy mechanisms as well as cultural and structural factors shape organizational adoption of IT and the resulting organizational performance impacts. In particular, telecommunications infrastructure is a complementary country-specific asset whose quality shapes the extent to which firms can apply IT to improve organizational performance.

## Limitations and Future Research

Although we have endeavored to achieve the highest levels of objectivity, accuracy, and validity, our analysis is not without limitations. The resource-based view of the firm has emerged as the leading theory within strategy research (Barney 2001) and is used in various management literatures including marketing (Fahy and Smithee 1999) and international business (Peng 2001). However, although there is growing consensus that the RBV provides a robust framework for viewing the sources of competitive advantages within firms (Barney 2001; Peteraf and Barney 2003), it is not without criticism (Priem and Butler 2001). Despite its synthesis of economics rationale with a managerial perspective, RBV is sometimes criticized as drawing too heavily from economics. The selection of articles followed a carefully prescribed set of procedures and we endeavored to achieve complete objectivity and comprehensiveness. However, selection may have been implicitly influenced by existing biases. Attention to the included articles in prior reviews potentially mitigated this threat, as did the suggestions of outside reviewers. In summary, despite its limitations, we are hopeful that our analysis not only sheds light on a difficult and complex subject, but also shines a ray, albeit modest, on the future.

The research agenda resulting from our analysis relates to each of the five research questions identified herein. Although a great deal of research has examined the value of the technological IT resource, several aspects of the first research question remain relatively understudied. For example, case and field studies of specific organizational contexts might shed light on the different dimensions of organizational performance resulting from different types of IT deployment, e.g., infrastructure versus business applications. In addition, quantitative empirical studies of emergent forms of IT, including e-business and Web services, might benefit from a growing range of statistics collected by national governments, as documented for the U.S. by Tehan (2003). Moreover, quantitative and qualitative research examining the synergies between human IT expertise (HIR) and technological IT resources (TIR) would improve understanding of how they interact and inform implications for competitive advantage, as suggested by Proposition 1B.

Moving to the second research question, much work remains to uncover which resources are synergistic with which types of IT and in what contexts. In particular, empirical studies assessing the degree of imitability—perhaps using primary survey data as in Powell and Dent-Micallef (1997) and Tallon et al. (2000)—would improve our understanding of the sustainability of competitive advantage resulting from synergies between IT and complementary resources. Combining multiple levels from the integrative model within a single analysis may also inform the question of complementarities. For example, is the use of decentralized decision making combined with greater information sharing dependent upon business processes or industry characteristics? Case studies controlling for IT and non-IT resources would inform understanding. Future research examining the ability of firms to apply IT successfully may build upon the capabilities perspective of the resource-based view (Grant 1991).

Our analysis also identifies several research streams concerning the external environment. We know very little about how industry characteristics moderate the degree of IT business value. As data on such characteristics as unionization and competitiveness are often collected by national governments, this represents a potentially fruitful area of future research. In addition, the dynamic capabilities extension to the RBV may be useful in understanding dynamic markets characterized by rapid change (Eisenhardt and Martin 2000; Teece et al. 1997). For example, are the practices of Dell in the PC industry adaptable to slower clockspeed industries such as wood products? Case and field studies are required to build a foundation for understanding the role of trading partner resources on the focal firm's ability to generate IT business value. Building from initial studies of the role of trading partners (Chatfield and Yetton 2000; Mukhopadhyay and Kekre 2002), further research might draw from conceptual work on value creation and capture (Bowman and Ambrosini 2000). The literature on interorganizational relationships (Barringer and Harrison 2000), transaction cost economics, and agency theory might also be useful. Finally, studies that incorporate macro characteristics, whether in multiple case studies or in empirical research, are needed to examine which macro characteristics are salient and how they may interact with one another in shaping the ability of firms to apply IT for organizational improvement. The examination of similar firms in a single industry across multiple countries might enable the isolation of macro factors that are the source of differential IT business value.
